Decades of research show that the most effective goals are:
 
S          Specific. Kids with specific goals improve 90% more often than kids with vague goals. A specific goal answers questions like:
            -  What do I want to accomplish?
            - Why?
            - How will I know I have accomplished my goal?

M         Measurable. This helps kids monitor their progress. It also helps them to break a goal down into smaller steps, which keeps motivation high. A measurable goal answers questions like:
            - How much?
            – How many?
            – How will I know when I am half way there? How will I know when I'm done? 

A         Attainable. Yet challenging. Easy goals are boring and unrewarding. Impossible goals are discouraging. A goal that is challenging but attainable puts kids in a state of flow. This is when the magic happens. When setting a goal, your child should be able to answer:
            -How will I meet this goal?
            -What steps will I need to take?
            -What problems will I face? How will I beat them?

R         Relevant. If a goal has no meaning to your child, they won’t care about achieving it.  It’s as simple as that. Your child should be able to answer:
            -Why do I want to do this?
- Why is this important?
- What other things will this help me do?

T         Time-bound. This helps kids stay focused, and it can add meaning to the goal. You can also use time to break a big goal into several smaller ones.
- When will I meet my goal?
- What will I be able to do by tomorrow?
- What can I do by next week?
