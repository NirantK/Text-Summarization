footage too graphic to be shown
the entire accident is caught on camera the driver pauses after hitting the child his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second
within two minutes three people pass two year old wang yue by the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely others look at her before moving off
there were other people who walked past wang yue and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised
i wonder how many of you looking at that said to yourselves just now
i would not have done that i would have stopped to help raise your hands if that thought occurred to you as i thought that 's most of you and i believe you i 'm sure you 're right
but before you give yourself too much credit
look at this unicef reports that in two thousand and eleven
six point nine million children under five
died from preventable poverty related
i don 't think it does make a morally relevant difference
and the answer is yes we can each of us
spends money on things that we do not really need you can think what your own habit is whether it 's a new car a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink
you could take the money you 're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization the against malaria foundation
and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one
and we know reliably that if we provide nets
fortunately more and more people are understanding this idea and the result is a growing movement effective altruism it 's important because it combines both the heart and the head the heart of course you felt you felt the empathy for that child
but it 's really important to use the head as well
to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed and not only that but also i think reason helps us
to understand that other people wherever they are are like us
so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want it does help us to put perspective on our situation
and i think that 's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism
have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math and that might seem surprising because a lot of people think philosophy is remote from the real world economics we 're told just makes us more selfish
and we know that math is for nerds
but in fact it does make a difference and in fact there 's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective
that 's the understanding the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history bill and melinda gates and warren buffett
has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three
and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective
according to one estimate the gates foundation has already saved five point eight million lives and many millions more people getting diseases that would have made them very sick even if eventually
well you might say that 's fine if you 're a billionaire you can have that kind of impact but if i 'm not what can i do so i 'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving
they worry how much of a difference they can make but you don 't have to be a billionaire this is toby ord
he 's a research fellow in philosophy at the university of oxford
he became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career an academic career he could give enough
to cure eighty thousand people of blindness in developing countries and still
have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living so toby founded an organization called giving what we can to spread this information to unite people who want to share some of their income and to ask people to pledge to give ten percent
of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty
toby himself does better than that
he 's pledged to live on eighteen thousand pounds a year that 's less than thirty thousand dollars
and to give the rest to those organizations and yes toby is married and he does have a mortgage
this is a couple at a later stage of life charlie bresler and diana schott who when they were young when they met were activists against the vietnam war
and then moved into careers as most people do didn 't really do anything very active about those values although they didn 't abandon them and then as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement
they returned to them and they 've decided to cut back on their spending to live modestly and to give both money and time
to helping to fight global poverty
one person who 's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is will crouch
he 's a graduate student in philosophy and he 's set up a website
called eighty thousand hours the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career to advise people on how to have the best most effective career
but you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider if they have the right abilities and character is to go into banking or finance why
because if you earn a lot of money
you can give away a lot of money
and if you 're successful in that career you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ let 's say five
aid workers in developing countries and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done
so you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career
here 's one young man who 's taken this advice his name is matt weiger he was a student at princeton in philosophy and math actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated
but he 's gone into finance in new york he 's already earning enough so that he 's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on
matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i 'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book i wrote the life you can save which is trying to change our culture so that
more people think that if we 're going to live an ethical life it 's not enough just to follow the thou shalt nots and not cheat steal maim kill but that if we have enough we have to share some of that with people who have so little
and the organization draws together people of different generations like holly morgan who 's an undergraduate who 's pledged to give ten percent of the little amount that she has and on the right ada wan who has worked directly for the poor but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give
many people will think though that
charities aren 't really all that effective so let 's talk about effectiveness toby ord is very concerned about this and he 's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others so it 's very important to find the effective ones
take for example providing a guide dog for a blind person
so you do the sums and you get something like that you could provide one guide dog for one blind american or you could cure between four hundred and two thousand people of blindness
i think it 's clear what 's the better thing to do but if you want to look for effective charities
this is a good website to go to
so it 's very tough if you want to look for other recommendations thelifeyoucansave com and giving what we can both have a somewhat broader list
but you can find effective organizations
and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor i 'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective
animal organizations that 's another cause that i 've been concerned about all my life the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally
tens of billions of animals every year so if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering you can go to effective animal activism and some effective
my final question is some people will think it 's a burden to give
i don 't really believe it is i 've enjoyed giving all of my life since i was a graduate student it 's been something fulfilling to me
charlie bresler said to me that he 's not an altruist he thinks that the life he 's saving is his own and holly morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism and now is one of the happiest people she knows
i think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what i call the sisyphus problem
condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill just as he gets there the effort becomes too much the boulder escapes rolls all the way down the hill he has to trudge back down to push it up again and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity
does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle where you work hard to get money you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you 'll enjoy using
but then the money 's gone you have to work hard to get more spend more and to maintain the same level of happiness it 's kind of a hedonic treadmill you never get off and you never really feel satisfied
becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment it enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life
was really worth living i 'm going to conclude
by telling you about an email that i received while i was writing this talk just a month or so ago
this is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery why was he recovering from surgery the email began last tuesday i anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger that started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys
there 's about one hundred people each year in the u s and more in other countries who do that i was pleased to read it chris went on to say that he 'd been influenced by my writings in what he did well i have to admit i 'm also somewhat embarrassed by that because i still have two kidneys
but chris went on to say that he didn 't think that what he 'd done was all that amazing because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people the extension of life
was about the same that you could achieve if you gave five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation
and that did make me feel a little bit better because i have given more than five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation
and to various other effective charities so if you 're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well there 's a way for you to get off the hook
