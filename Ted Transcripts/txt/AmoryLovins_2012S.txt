or b climate change or c nuclear holocaust
or d all of the above
could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire
you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable
they 've created our wealth they 've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity
each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they 're really quite distinct less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal
their uses are quite concentrated three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation three fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient
vehicles buildings and factories save oil and coal and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today 's energy system is not just inefficient
it is also disconnected aging dirty and insecure
so it needs refurbishment by two thousand and fifty though it could become efficient
connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient
electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by two thousand and fifty and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply
this could cost by two thousand and fifty five
trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today
yet this cheaper energy system could support one hundred and fifty eight percent bigger u s economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress
and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock
let me say that again i 'm going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of congress led by business for profit
in other words we 're going to use our most effective institutions
private enterprise co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health
reinventing fire makes sense and makes money
general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy
transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy
but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp
our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let 's start by making autos oil free two thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight
and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units in the tank because you don 't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels
unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultralight ultrastrong materials like carbon fiber composites
can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build
lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells
also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform
automakers from wringing tiny savings out of victorian engine and seal stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other
namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sales can grow
and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones and just in the first two years the biggest of europe 's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now america 's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished
so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next forty years but then also make electrification affordable and that
displaces the rest of the oil america could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is germany last year volkswagen
announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting two hundred and thirty miles a gallon also last year bmw announced this carbon fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker
seven years ago an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to
make this little carbon fiber test part
which doubles as a carbon cap
and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don 't worry about dropping it it 's tougher than titanium tom friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it
but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to twelve times as much crash energy per pound as steel if we made all of our autos this way
it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias or half an opec by drilling in the detroit formation a very prospective play and all those mega barrels under detroit cost an average of eighteen bucks a barrel they are all american carbon free and inexhaustible
the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles in the five years ending with two thousand and ten walmart saved sixty percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds
and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars
also today 's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military r d has given us the internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries
as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving
instead of just seeing the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing
we can allow smart and lucrative growth models
that help people already be near where they want to be so they don 't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart it to make traffic free flowing
together those things can give us the same or better access
with forty six to eighty four percent less driving saving another zero point four trillion dollars plus zero point three trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile u s economy can use no oil
so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuels those one hundred and twenty five to two hundred and forty mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any
mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil
and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day
can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the
business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like ford and walmart and the pentagon and the long transition is already
well under way in fact three years ago
mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and deutsche bank even said world oil use could peak around two thousand and sixteen in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified
vehicles don 't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they 're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate
varying solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story
saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity
will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector because we 've got twenty first century technology and speed colliding head on
with twentieth and nineteenth century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted
and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we 're installing them so the
but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy america 's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos
and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next forty years buildings which use three quarters of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving one point four trillion dollars
net present value with a thirty three percent internal rate of return
or in english the savings are worth four times what they cost and industry can accelerate too doubling its energy productivity with a twenty one percent internal rate of return
the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design
that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our two thousand and ten retrofit is saving over two fifths of the energy in the empire state building
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements
and reduce the payback to just three years
but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world 's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turn them can
have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating thirty five improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes
but a standard industrial pumping loop
was redesigned to use at least eighty six percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes
this is not about new technology it 's just rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs
so what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors
well from the coal burned at the power plant
through all these compounding losses
only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow but now let 's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe
saves ten units of fuel cost pollution and what hunter lovins calls global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper
our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than thirty billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries
typically our retrofit designs save about thirty to sixty percent of the energy and pay back in a few years while the new facility designs save forty to ninety odd percent
with generally lower capital cost now
needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables china leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart
and germany now has more solar workers than america has steel workers
already in about twenty states
private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company
and this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world 's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries
in two thousand and ten renewables other than big hydro
particularly wind and solar cells got one hundred and fifty one billion dollars of private investment
and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up sixty or seventy percent a year in contrast
the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those
keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of one hundred plus percent subsidies
cost but we only need to replace them once
we 're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they 're twenty four seven whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is twenty four seven they all break
and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds
often for weeks or months often without warning
that is exactly why we 've designed the grid
to back up failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle wind and solar power 's forecastable variations
and that 's true both for continental areas like the u s or europe
and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example four german states in two thousand and ten were forty three to fifty two percent wind powered portugal was forty five percent renewable powered denmark thirty six and it 's how all of europe
can shift to renewable electricity
in america our aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by two thousand and fifty and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same
about six trillion dollars at present value whether we buy more of what we 've got or new nuclear and so called clean coal or renewables that are more or less centralized but
those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health
for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack
but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables
organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly
that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they 're defending we want our stuff to work too
at about the same cost as business as usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse
dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables
and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in thirty four states for selling you more electricity
however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no
bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible
but with today 's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do
far more and even cheaper
so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but as marshall mcluhan said only puny secrets need
protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity
now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important
so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america 's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global
challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which make us less safe
because he said they simply won 't be around long term
i 've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above
not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly
efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing
each of you owns a piece of that dollar five trillion prize
and our new book reinventing fire
describes how you can capture it
so with the conversation just begun at reinventingfire com let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler
