i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod an ipod that contains wagner and mozart pop diva christina aquilera
and one who lives for my home theater a home theater where i devour dvds video on demand and a lot of television
for me law and order svu tine fey and thirty rock and judge judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are
i'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for judge judy
and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but i'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life
a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theater and and more and more
you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology
while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the internet is if anything too effective in that regard
depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer
now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen see every single day we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time
five yeas ago gen x 'ers spent twenty point seven hours online and tv the majority on tv gen y 'ers spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online
and now a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games
we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep
we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types expectations of personalization and customization
that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attendant inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet
and we're all acutely aware what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket
cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet twenty four hours a day for ninety nine cents a song
or for free these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not
all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more
saddled in the performing arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming
locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the nineteenth century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices
many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask ourselves are we next
everyone i talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of adrienne rich who in doctoreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they
now rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation i prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation a reformation like the religious reformation of the sixteenth century
the arts reformation like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation
both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models
and at heart both reformations i think were asking the questions who 's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice
and indeed do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual
chris anderson someone i trust you all know editor and chief of wired magazine and author of the long tail really was the first for me to nail a lot of this
he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web technology mini cams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history
and now who in this room doesn't know a fourteen year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie
similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the
warner bros rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own
this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author
but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations
this group others have called the pro ams amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on youtube in dance competitions film festivals and more
they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the
cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation
they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home
but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is by far too short sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional
the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist
the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women 's rights or human rights or on global warming issues or aids relief for more
not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment
today 's dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada but by liz lerman 's dance exchange
a multi generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from eighteen to eighty two
and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern today 's professional theater community is defined not only the shaw and stratford festivals
but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles a collective of artists that after nine eleven brought together ten different religious communities
the muslim the jewish even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays
and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross
today 's performers like rhodessa jones work in women 's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today 's playwrights and directors work with young gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and
and more and indeed i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been
for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely i hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community
empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially
as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters
and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience
and in a context of analysis where the thing we hear most repeatedly day in day out in the united states
in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you
when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us
to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we ever needed that capacity in human history we need it
you know we're bound together not i think by technology entertainment and design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies
to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful substantive
i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be
i promise you the hand of the doris duke charitable foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon thank you
