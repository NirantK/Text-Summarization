context your friends your family or your financiers okay friends family and financiers
need to understand what we understand about corruption
and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it and we have to admit that we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it the first thing is that the big myth number one
is that in fact it 's not really a crime when we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country crime in belmont or crime in diego or crime in marabella nobody 's speaking about corruption that 's the honest truth
the second important myth to understand because we have to destroy these myths dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them the second important myth to understand is the one that says that
that that too is a dangerous myth very dangerous it 's a piece of public mischief and i want to speak a little bit take us back about thirty years
the first thing i want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about forty years ago
we embarked the government of the day embarked on a series of government to government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country
it became so outrageous the whole situation that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed and it reported in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two thirty years ago it reported the ballah report thirty years ago and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped
's what he told us he told us that in fact
so the ten or fifteen percent is pure mischief
as we say it 's a nancy story forget it that 's for little children we are big people and we 're trying to deal with what 's happening in our society okay this is the size of the problem okay two thirds of the money stolen or wasted that was thirty years ago one thousand nine hundred and eighty two was ballah so what has changed
i don 't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience but i have to
four months ago we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country we call it the section thirty four fiasco the section thirty four fiasco a suspicious piece of law and i 'm going to say it like it is a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects
we are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature do you get how serious this problem is there was massive protest a lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms most importantly the american embassy complained so parliament was swiftly reconvened and the law was reversed it was repealed that 's the word lawyers use it was repealed but the point is
because of the suspicious passage of that law the law was actually passed into effect
we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity corrupt activity took place and to get an idea of what it consisted of and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing we can look at this second slide here
and what we have here i am not saying so this is the director of public prosecutions in a written statement he said so
and he 's telling us that for the dollar one point six billion cost of the project one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts one billion dollars of our taxpayers money has been located in offshore bank accounts
being the kind of suspicious person i am i am outraged at that and i 'm going to pause here i 'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things i 'm going to pause here and bring in something i saw in november last year at wall street i was at zuccotti park it was autumn it was cool it was damp it was getting dark
and i was walking around with the protesters looking at the one wall street occupy wall street movement walking around and there was a lady with a sign a very simple sign a kind of battered looking blonde lady and the sign was made out of bristol board as we say in these parts and it was made with a marker
and what it said on that sign hit me right in the center it said if you 're not outraged you haven 't been paying attention
this wasn 't the first time what if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught
what if it had happened before how would i find out
corruption okay and i have the privilege at this time to lead the joint consultative council which is a not for profit we 're at jcc org tt and we have the we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted
so those of you interested in finding out more about it or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions please get involved
and without getting into all of the details it is said to have collapsed i 'm using my words very carefully it 's said to have collapsed in january of nine which is just coming up to nearly four years
and i can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn 't happened anywhere else on the planet
have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were only here so what was the reason for the generosity
is our government that generous and maybe they are let 's look at it let 's look into it so i started digging and writing and so and so on and that work can be found my personal work can be found at afraraymond com which is my name it 's a not for profit blog that i run not as popular as some of the other people but there you
to check myself and recalculate my bearings and to go back into some of the work some of the stuff i 'd written and some of the exchanges i 'd had with the officials to see what was really what as we say in trinidad and tobago who is who and what is what okay we want to try to recalculate and i made a freedom of information application in
may this year to the ministry of finance the ministry of finance is the next tower over this is the other context the ministry of finance we are told is subject to the provisions of the freedom of information act i 'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that 's really so
the central bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the freedom of information act so in fact you can 't ask them anything and they don 't have to answer anything that is the law since one thousand nine
i asked to see the accounts of cl financial and if you can 't show me the accounts
the minister of finance is making statements passing new laws and giving speeches and so on what are the figures he 's relying on it 's like that joke i want whatever he 's drinking and they wrote back and said to me well what do you really mean so they hit my question with a question second point
using that act of parliament freedom of information act to release the information and i thought that was excellent you see
but the ministry of finance the permanent secretary of the ministry of finance wrote me and said to me that information is exempt too you see this is what we 're dealing with okay the third thing i will tell you is that i also asked
for the directors of cl financial whether in fact they were making filings under our integrity in public life act we have an integrity in public life act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation 's interest and public officials are supposed to file to say what it is
they have in terms of assets and liabilities and of course i 've since discovered that they 're not filing and in fact the minister of finance has not even asked them to file so here we have it we have a situation where
the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded i 've asked the question in the legal and required fashion it 's been ignored the sort of thing that motivated us around section thirty four we need to continue to work on that we can 't forget it
i have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country 's history it 's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation
and this is my reality check where you have an expenditure of public money
and it is without accountability and it 's without transparency it will always be equal to corruption whether you 're in russia or nigeria or alaska it will always be equal to corruption and that is what we are dealing with here i 'm going to continue the work to press on to get
some resolution of those matters at the ministry of finance if it is i have to go to court personally i will do that we will continue to press on we will continue to work within jcc but i want to step back from the trinidad and tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example we had the journalist heather brooke speaking
we can work on it together we need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point we need to increase the consciousness the final thing i want to say is in relation to this one which is a lovely website from india
discard the second myth it is a big thing it 's a huge problem it 's an economic crime
