this is happening all over the country there are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the united states on this map the colored areas represent water conflicts
similar problems are emerging in the east as well the reasons vary state to state but mostly in the details there are four thousand miles of dewatered streams in montana
alone they would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife they 're the veins of the ecosystem and they 're often empty veins
i want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it 's an archetype for the larger story this is prickly pear creek it runs through a populated area from east helena to lake helena
it supports wild fish including cutthroat brown and rainbow trout nearly every year for more than a hundred years
it 's looked like this in the summer how did we get here well it started back in the late one thousand eight hundred s when people started settling in places like montana in short there was a lot of water and there weren 't very many people
but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little concerned and in one thousand eight hundred and sixty five montana passed its first water law it basically said everybody near the stream can share in the stream oddly a lot of people showed up wanting to share
had the first or senior water rights these senior water rights
along with the economic value that goes with it so they have no incentive to conserve
so it 's not just about the number of people
the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don 't use it so after decades of lawsuits and one hundred and forty years now of experience we still have this
it 's a broken system there 's a disincentive to conserve because if you don 't use your water right you can lose your water right and i 'm sure you all know this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities
there 's another thing happening around the country which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand
well it 's a national problem but i 'm going to tell you another story from montana and it involves beer i bet you didn 't know it takes about five pints of water to make a pint of beer if you include all the
so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem these ecosystems are really important to the montana brewers and their customers after all there 's a strong correlation between water and fishing
and for some there 's a strong correlation between fishing and beer laughter so the montana brewers and their customers are concerned and they 're looking for some way to address the problem so how can they address this remaining water
footprint remember prickly pear up until now business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing and we 're suggesting that the next step
is to restore remember prickly pear it 's a broken system you 've got a disincentive to
senior water rights holders can leave their water in stream
while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right
after all it is their water right and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream it 's their right to do so but they have no incentive to do so so working with local water trusts we created an incentive to do so
we pay them to leave their water in stream that 's what 's happening here this individual has made the choice
and is closing this water diversion leaving the water in the stream he doesn 't lose the water right he just chooses to apply that right or some portion of it to the stream instead of to the land
because he 's the senior water rights holder he can protect the water from other users in the stream
this guy 's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream
we then take the measured water we divide it into thousand gallon increments
each increment gets a serial number and a certificate and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems the brewers pay to restore water to the stream
it provides a simple inexpensive and measurable way
to return water to these degraded ecosystems while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them after one hundred and forty years of conflict and one hundred years of dry streams
a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved
we put together a market based willing buyer willing seller solution a solution that does not require litigation
it 's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it 's critically needed into these degraded ecosystems while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice
about how their water is used these transactions create allies not enemies they connect people rather than dividing them and they provide needed economic support for rural communities and most importantly it 's working we 've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems
we 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana with hotels and tea companies in oregon and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest and when we make these connections
we can and we do turn this into this
