quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning
anyway it's just great to see such a full theater and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation the
things of course is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology
and of course what he said about listening to our young people of course my job is all about listening and
my aim really is to teach the world to listen that's my only real aim in life and it sounds quite simple but actually
it's quite a big big job because you know when you
look at a piece of music for example if i just open
my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music
that is full of little black dots on the page and you know we open it up
and i read the music so technically i can actually read this i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics i will do exactly as i'm told
maybe two lines or so
i'm being told which part of the stick to use and i'm being told the dynamic and i'm also being told that the drum is without
snares snares on snares off so therefore if i translate this piece of music we have this idea
so on my career would probably last about five years
what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music
everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher
it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting and that you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface
drum so there we experience the translation now we'll experience the interpretation
a little longer but in a way you know it's the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright
young lady with a pink top on i see that you're clutching a teddy bear et cetera et cetera so i get a basic idea as to
what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession et cetera et cetera however that's just you know the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look
and we try to interpret but actually it's so unbelievably shallow in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what
herbie said please listen listen we have to listen to ourselves first of all if i play for example holding the stick where literally i do not let go of the stick
more dynamic with less effort much more
and i just feel at last one with
the stick and one with the drum and i'm doing far far less so in the same way that i need time with this instrument i need time
with people in order to interpret them not just translate them but interpret them if for example
i play just a few bars of a piece of music for which
i think of myself as a technician that is someone who is basically a percussion player
so on if i think of myself as a musician
so on there is a little bit of a difference there
and i remember when i was twelve years old and i started playing tympani and percussion and
my teacher said well how are we going to do this you know music is about listening yes i agree with
so what's the problem and he said well how are you going to hear this how are you going to hear that and i said well how do you hear it he said well
i think i hear it through here and i said well i think i do too but i also hear it through my hands through my arms
cheekbones my scalp my tummy my chest my legs and so on and so we began our lessons every single time
drums in particular the kettle drums or tympani to such a narrow pitch interval so something like a
it's amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference
be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there and so what we would do is that i would put my hands
on the wall of the music room and together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments and really try to connect
with those sounds far far more broadly than simply depending on the ear because of course the
i mean subject to all sorts of things the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument the type of sticks all different
same amount of weight but different sound colors and that's basically what we are we're just human beings but we all have
little sound colors as it were that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things
and as i grew older i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london and they said well no we won 't accept you because we haven't a clue you know of the future of a so called
and i just couldn't quite accept that and so therefore i
said to them well look if you
if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love
the art of creating sound then we have to think very very hard about the people you do actually
and as a result once we got over a little hurdle and having to audition twice they accepted me and not only that what had happened was that it changed the whole
role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever
on the basis of whether someone had no arms no legs they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry and every single entry had to be listened to
experienced and then based on the musical ability then that person could either enter or not so therefore this
meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions
is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound which is basically all of us and we well know that music really is
daily medicine i say music but actually i mean sound because you know some of the extraordinary things i've experienced as a musician when you may have
a fifteen year old lad who has got the most incredible challenges who may not be able to control
his movements who may be deaf who may be blind et cetera et cetera suddenly if that young lad sits close to this instrument
and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba and you play something that's so incredibly organ like
almost i don't really have the right sticks perhaps but something like this let me change
so unbelievably simple but he would be experiencing something that i
because i'm on top of the sound i have the sound coming this way
he would have the sound coming through the resonators if there were no resonators on here we would have
so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience
what type of sound i want to produce for example this sound
can you hear anything exactly because i'm not even touching it
i mean just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience and not by
learning a piece of music putting on someone else's interpretation of it buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music and so on and so forth because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so
basic and something that i can fully experience the journey of so it may be that in certain halls this dynamic may well
that in other halls they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be
you see what i mean so because of this explosion in access to sound
especially through the deaf community this has not only affected how music institutions how schools for the deaf
treat sound and not just as a means of therapy although of course being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well but it's meant that
acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together there are so few halls in this world that actually
have very good acoustics dare i say but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine
the tiniest softest softest sound to something that is so broad so huge so incredible
is incredible for which you can play exactly what you imagine without it being
and so therefore acousticians are actually in conversation with
people who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound and this is quite interesting i cannot you know give you
detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people
if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot walk it may be that they can walk three four five steps that to them means they can walk
in a year 's time it could be two extra steps in another year 's time three extra steps those are hugely important aspects to think about
so when we do listen to each other it's unbelievably important for us to really
test our listening skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment
for me as a musician who deals with ninety nine percent of new music it's very easy for me to say oh yes i like that piece oh no i don't like that piece and so on
and you know i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time
it may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music but that doesn't mean i have the right to say it's a bad piece of music
and you know it's just one of the great things about being a musician is that it's so unbelievably fluid
so there are no rules no right no wrong this way that way if i asked you to
maybe i can do this if i can just say please clap and create the sound of thunder i'm assuming we've all experienced thunder
now i don't mean just the sound i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create that through your clapping try just please try
try again try again snow you're awake
you know the interesting thing here though is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question
now great imagination thank you very much however not one of you got out of your seats to think right how can i
in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands in the same way that when we listen to music we assume that it's all being fed through here this is how we experience
music of course it's not we experience thunder thunder thunder think think think listen listen listen
now what can we do with thunder i remember my teacher
when i first started my very first lesson i was all prepared with sticks ready to go and instead of him saying ok evelyn please
slightly apart arms at a more or less ninety degree angle sticks in a more or less v shape
i would not be able to strike the drum because i was thinking of so many other things he said evelyn take this drum away for seven days and i'll see you next week
so heavens what was i to do i no longer required the sticks i wasn't allowed to have these sticks i had to basically look
at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did what the snares did turned it upside down experimented with the shell head
with all sorts of bruises and things like
it was such an unbelievable experience because then where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music
where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book so we never ever dealt with actual study books so
one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician is basically straightforward single stroke rolls
like that and then we get a little faster
what does this piece require single stroke rolls
why can't i then do that whilst learning a piece of music and that's exactly what he did and interestingly the older i became when i became a full time student at a so called music institution
all of that went out of the window we had to study from study books and constantly the question well why why what is this relating to i need to play a piece of music oh well this will help your control
well how why do i need to learn that i need to relate it to a piece of music you know i need to say something why am i practicing
is it just literally for control for hand stick control why am i doing that i need to have the reason and the reason has to be
by saying something through the music and by saying something through music which basically is sound
we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people but i don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage that's up to you when you walk through a hall because that
then determines what and how we listen to certain things i may feel sorrowful or happy
exhilarated or angry when i play certain pieces of music but i'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing so please the next time you go to a concert just
allow your body to open up allow your body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing
as the performer is the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound they're hearing the contact of the stick on
the drum or the mallet on the bit of wood or the the string et cetera
which is before the sound is actually happening please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike or
is being pulled just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference rather than just arriving
last night i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses but thank you very much for having
