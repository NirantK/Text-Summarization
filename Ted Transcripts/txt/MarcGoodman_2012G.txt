the future of crime and terrorism and frankly i 'm afraid
and that 's informed my perspective on things i 've been a street police officer an undercover investigator a counter terrorism strategist and i 've worked in more than seventy countries around the world i 've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society
and that 's informed my opinions
my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational they have taught me a lot and i 'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you
today i 'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at the ones that we love in the hands of the ted community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world
but in the hands of suicide bombers the future can look quite different
i started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer in those days this was the height of technology laugh though you will all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did
twenty years later criminals are still using mobile phones
but they 're also building their own mobile phone networks like this one which has been deployed in all thirty one states of mexico by the narcos they have a national encrypted radio communications system
think about that think about the innovation that went into that think about the infrastructure to build it and then think about this why can 't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco
we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do technology has made our world increasingly open and for the most part that 's great
they threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work
but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them
they were armed with mobile phones they had blackberries they had access to satellite imagery they had satellite phones and they even had night vision goggles
but perhaps their greatest innovation was this
we 've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news this is an operations center and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan
where they monitored the bbc al jazeera cnn and indian local stations they also monitored the internet and social media
to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed
they did all of this in real time the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government
what did they do with this they used it to great effect at one point during the sixty hour siege the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed and they said to him who are you and what are you doing here and the man replied
i 'm just an innocent schoolteacher
of course the terrorists knew
that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj they picked up his identification and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room
where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said your hostage is he heavyset
is he bald in front
does he wear glasses yes
yes yes came the answers the op center had found him and they had a match he was not a schoolteacher he was the second wealthiest businessman in india and after discovering this information the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in mumbai
we all worry about our privacy settings on facebook
but the fact of the matter is our openness can be used against us terrorists are doing this a search engine can determine who shall live
during the mumbai siege terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand
in the end three hundred people were gravely wounded and over one hundred and seventy two men women and children lost their lives that day
think about what happened during this sixty hour siege on mumbai ten men armed not just with weapons but with technology were able to bring a city of twenty million people
to a standstill ten people brought twenty million people to a standstill and this traveled around the world
this is what radicals can do with openness
this was done nearly four years ago
what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have what will they do tomorrow
the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially and it 's scaling for good and it 's scaling for evil
it 's not just about terrorism though there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime you see
you can now commit more crime as well in the old days it was a knife and a gun then criminals moved to robbing trains you could rob two hundred people on a train a great innovation
moving forward the internet allowed things to scale even more in fact many of you will remember the recent sony playstation hack in that incident over one hundred million people were robbed
think about that when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob one hundred million
of course it 's not just about stealing things there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit
many of you will remember this super cute video from the last
and cute they don 't all have drumsticks some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters or as in this little bit of movie magic quadcopters can be
loaded with firearms and automatic weapons little robots
every time a new technology
being introduced criminals are there to exploit it we 've all seen three d printers we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete with great precision i actually was able to make this
just the other day a very cute little ducky
but i wonder to myself for those people that strap
bombs to their chests and blow themselves up how might they use three d printers perhaps
the uk i know has some very strict firearms laws
you needn 't bring the gun into the uk anymore you just bring the three d printer and print the gun while you 're here and of course the magazines for your bullets but as these get bigger in the future what other items will you be able to print the technologies are allowing bigger printers as we move forward
that the internet of things will soon be
the internet of things to be hacked all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies and that has a radical implication for our security because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities
criminals understand this terrorists understand this hackers understand this if you control the code you control the world
this is the future that awaits us there has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn 't been hacked
that 's troubling since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology
as we 've seen here we 're transforming ourselves into cyborgs every year thousands of cochlear implants diabetic pumps pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people in the united states there are sixty thousand people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet
the defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it but if you don 't need it and somebody else gives you the shock
operating system dna and to hackers dna is just another operating system waiting to be hacked it 's a great challenge for them there are people already working on hacking the software of life and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all
some won 't be so how will criminals abuse this well with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things
for example i predict that we will move away from a plant based narcotics world to a synthetic one why do you need the plants anymore you can just take the dna code from marijuana
or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you or the marijuana or any other drug
so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting in fact we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century
the cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously it was proceeding at moore 's law pace but then in two thousand and eight something changed the technologies got better and now
dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore 's law
that has significant implications for us
it took us thirty years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today
but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly and knowing criminals and terrorists as i do we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future
it will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio virus enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax weaponized flu we recently saw a case where some researchers made the h five n one avian influenza virus more potent
it already has a seventy percent mortality rate if you get it but it 's hard to get engineers by moving around a small number of genetic changes were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch so that not thousands of people would die but tens of millions you see you can
go ahead and create new pandemics and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this
and get access to this information
but it goes deeper than that
dna researcher andrew hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments modern cancer treatments to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact
then you can also go after any one person 's cell personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons
how will we protect them in the future what to do
what to do about all this that 's what i get asked all the time for those of you who follow me on twitter i will be tweeting out the answer later on today
actually it 's a bit more complex than that and there are no magic bullets i don 't have all the answers but i know a few things in the wake of nine eleven the best security minds
put together all their innovation and this is what they created
for security if you 're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse
doesn 't scale globally at least it hasn 't and our current system of guns border guards big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we 're moving
so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats like attacking a president or a prime minister this would be the natural government response to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles but this is not going to work the cost of doing a dna sequence is going to be trivial anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future
so maybe there 's a more radical way that we can look at this what happens if we were to take the president 's dna or a king or queen 's and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders
or what if we sent it out to a few thousand or controversially and not without its risks what happens if we just gave it to the whole public
then we could all be engaged in helping we 've already seen examples of this working well the organized crime and corruption reporting project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd sourcing
what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world and in a more dramatic case we 've seen in mexico a country that has been racked by fifty thousand narcotics related murders in the past six years
whether or not you realize it we are at the dawn of a technological arms race an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill the threat is serious and the time to prepare for it is now
i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are my personal belief is that rather than having a small elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all
we 're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do if we all do our part i think we 'll be in a much better space the tools to change the world are in everybody 's hands how we use them is not just up to me it 's up to all of us
this was a technology i would frequently deploy as a police officer this technology has become outdated in our current world
it doesn 't scale it doesn 't work globally and it surely doesn 't work virtually we 've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism they call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement
so i invite you to join me after all public safety is too important to leave to the professionals thank you
