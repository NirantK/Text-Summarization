am a reformed marketer and i now work in international development in october i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo which is the second largest country in africa in fact it 's as large as western europe but it only has three hundred miles of paved roads
the drc is a dangerous place in the past ten years
in fact the hiv prevalence rate is one point three percent among adults
this might not sound like a large number but in a country with seventy six million people it means there are nine hundred and thirty thousand that are infected and due to the poor infrastructure only twenty five percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need
which is why in part donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost and so while i was in the drc i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms including damien
damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa it 's a hotel that 's only open until midnight so it 's not a place that you stay but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come now damien knows all about condoms but he doesn 't sell them he said there 's just not in demand
it 's not surprising because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms
joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them
their customers don 't buy the branded versions they like the generics and as a marketer i found that curious and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like
by the donor agencies for these condoms fear financing and fidelity
they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them
show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom
what is it that you think about just before you get a condom
and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative
and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding who 's the audience and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working in it 's people back home
people that support their work people like these
but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer the people whose behavior needs to change the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it
