freshman year of college i signed up for an internship in the housing unit at greater boston legal services
up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies but was paired with this righteous deeply inspired attorney named jeff purcell who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day
and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in boston
who would come in presenting with housing issues
but always had an underlying health issue
so i had a client who came in about to be evicted because he hasn 't paid his rent
but he hasn 't paid his rent of course because he 's paying for his hiv medication and just can 't afford
we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning and one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles
and i would collect the cockroaches hot glue gun them to this poster board that we 'd bring to court for our cases and we always won because the judges were just so grossed out
far more effective i have to say than anything i later learned in law school but over the course of these nine months i grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients that by the time they came to us they were already in crisis
and at the end of my freshman year of college i read an article about the work that dr barry zuckerman was doing as chair of pediatrics at boston medical center and his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients
so i called barry and with his blessing in october one thousand nine hundred and ninety five walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center i 'll never forget the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons
and the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two three sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable
the doctors it seemed never really had enough time for all the patients try as they might and over the course of six months i would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question if you had unlimited resources what 's the one thing you would give your patients
and i heard the same story again and again a story we 've heard hundreds of times since then they said every day we have patients that come into the clinic child has an ear infection i prescribe antibiotics but the real issue is there 's no food at home
the real issue is that child is living with twelve other people in a two bedroom apartment and i don 't even ask about those issues because there 's nothing i can do
i have thirteen minutes with each patient patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room i have no idea where the nearest food pantry is and i don 't even have any help in that clinic even today there are two social workers for twenty four thousand pediatric patients which is better than a lot of the clinics out there
so health leads was born of these conversations a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication
patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources
so we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room totally lemonade stand style but today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly nine thousand patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy
so eighteen months ago i got this email that changed my life and the email was from dr jack geiger who had written to congratulate me on health leads and to share as he said a bit of historical context
in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five dr geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country in a brutally poor area in the mississippi delta
and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them and they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic
and when the office of economic opportunity in washington d c which was funding geiger 's clinic found out about this they were furious and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care
to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food
here we are forty five years after geiger has prescribed food for his patients and i have doctors telling me on those issues we practice a don 't ask don 't tell policy
forty five years after geiger health leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources
so i have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird groundhog day
how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients and especially low income patients healthy that we didn 't use it if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system why don 't we just do it
these questions in my mind are not hard because the answers are complicated
they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves my belief is that it 's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system or even admit that we have any at all because if we did they would be so removed from our current reality
but that doesn 't change my belief that all of us deep inside here in this room and across this country share a similar set of desires
what if we decided to make a different set of choices what if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say no these things are ours they will be used for
so that 's where health leads began we started with the prescription pad a very ordinary piece of paper and we asked not what do patients need to get healthy antibiotics an inhaler medication
and when the doctor begins the visit she knows height weight is there food at home is the family living in a shelter and that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient using health leads like any other sub specialty referral
the problem is once you get a taste of what it 's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare you want more so we thought if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption
and we gave it a shot so now at harlem hospital center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index
so on the one hand this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record
and on the other hand it 's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool in the private sector when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment it 's called a billion dollar company
but in my world it 's called reduced obesity and diabetes it 's called healthcare a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health not just manage disease same thing in the clinic waiting room
so every day in this country three million patients pass through about one hundred and fifty thousand clinic waiting rooms in this country and what do they do when they 're there they sit they watch the goldfish in the fish tank they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine
if airports can become shopping malls and mcdonald 's can become playgrounds surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room
and that 's what health leads has tried to do to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy
so it 's a brutal winter in the northeast your kid has asthma your heat just got turned off and of course you 're in the waiting room of the er because the cold air triggered your child 's asthma but what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously
the waiting room became the place where health leads turned your heat back on
we know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren 't enough that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining health just takes more time it requires a non clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others
what if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the eleven million college students in this country
now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make this kind of commitment i have two words for you march madness the average ncaa division i men 's basketball player dedicates thirty nine hours a week to his sport now we may think that 's good or bad
but in either case it 's real and health leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities
college sports teams say we 're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we 're going to measure your performance and your team 's performance and if you don 't measure up or you don 't show up we 're going to cut you off the team
but we 'll make huge investments in your training and development and we 'll give you an extraordinary community of peers
and people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it so our feeling is if it 's good enough for the rugby team it 's good enough for health and poverty
health leads too recruits competitively trains intensively coaches professionally demands significant time builds a cohesive team and measures results a kind of teach for america for healthcare
now in the top ten cities in the u s with the largest number of medicaid patients each of those has at least twenty thousand college students new york alone has half a million college students
and this isn 't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources it 's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline
and the thing is there 's thousands of these folks already out there
mia says when my classmates write a prescription they think their work is done
when i write a prescription i think can the family read the prescription do they have transportation to the pharmacy do they have food to take with the prescription do they have insurance to fill the prescription those are the questions i learned at health leads not in medical school
now none of these solutions the prescription pad the electronic medical record the waiting room the army of college students are perfect
so i had been at legal services for about nine months when this idea of health leads started percolating in my mind and i knew i had to tell jeff purcell my attorney that i needed to leave and i was so nervous because i thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea
when you have a vision you have an obligation to realize that vision you must pursue that vision and i have to say i was like whoa
waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare it will not be by the diseases cured but by the diseases prevented it will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists but by how rarely we needed them
and most of all i believe that when we measure healthcare it will be not by what the system was but by what we chose it to be thank you
