seven years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i made quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades
what struck me was that i q was not the only difference between my best and my worst students
some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric i q scores some of my smartest kids weren 't doing so well and that got me thinking
if they worked hard and long enough
after several more years of teaching
i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i q
but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily
so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study my question was who is successful here and why
my research team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition
we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students
we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who 's going to earn the most money
but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality grit is living life like it 's a marathon not a sprint
a few years ago i started studying grit in the chicago public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate
turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate
even when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school
so it 's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it 's also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out
to me the most shocking thing about grit
is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic how do i keep them motivated for the long run
the honest answer is i don 't know laughter what i do know is that talent doesn 't make you gritty
our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent
so far the best idea i 've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort
dr dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they 're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don 't believe that failure is a permanent condition
so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit
but we need more and that 's where i 'm going to end my remarks because that 's where we are that 's the work that stands before us
we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we 've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned i
