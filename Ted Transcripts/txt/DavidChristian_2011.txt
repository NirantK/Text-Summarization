yes it is a scrambled
egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works
is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure
in fact to mush and that 's why that video feels a bit strange and yet look around us
what we see around us is staggering complexity
into a global system of stupendous complexity
so here 's a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity i 've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center
well the answer seems to be the universe
can create complexity but with great difficulty in pockets
there appear what my colleague fred spier calls goldilocks conditions not too hot
not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage
each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments
and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it 's more difficult to create complexity
now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility
and that 's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe
so let 's do it
a universe appears an entire universe and we 've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it 's smaller than an atom it 's incredibly hot it contains everything that 's in today 's universe so you can imagine it 's busting and it 's expanding at incredible speed
and at first it 's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity
and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter
quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second
now we move forward three hundred and eighty thousand years
that 's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium
now i want to pause for a moment three hundred and eighty thousand years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage
we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they 're really a sort of cosmic mush
but that 's not completely true recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here
the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works
gravity is more powerful where there 's more stuff
so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds
and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of ten million degrees
protons start to fuse there 's a huge release of energy and bam
we have our first stars
from about two hundred million years after the big bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex
stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds when very large stars die they create
temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you 're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion
so now the universe is chemically more complex and in a chemically more complex universe it 's possible to make more things
and what starts happening is that around young suns young stars
all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four
now the going gets tougher the next stage introduces entities
so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry
what are the goldilocks conditions well first you need energy but not too much in the center of a star there 's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little in intergalactic space there 's so little energy that atoms can 't combine
what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they 're close to stars but not too close
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquid such as water why well in gasses atoms move past each other so fast that they can 't hitch up in solids
it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of open water and deep beneath those oceans at cracks in the earth 's crust
you 've got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you 've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course
life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it 's here that life introduces an entirely new trick
you don 't stabilize the individual
you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and dna of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information
you 'll be familiar with the double helix of dna each rung contains information so dna contains information about how to make living organisms
and dna also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story
the real beauty of dna though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion rungs there tends to be an error and what that means
is that dna is in effect learning it 's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work so dna 's learning and it 's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years
for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about six hundred to eight hundred million years ago multi celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish you get plants
you get amphibia you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs
and occasionally there are disasters
sixty five million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the yucatan peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs
but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished
as a threshold in this great story let me explain why we 've seen that dna learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow dna accumulates information through random errors some of which just happen to work
but dna had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time
they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them now what makes humans different is human language
we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise
that we can share what we 've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory
and that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that 's why as a species we 're so creative and so powerful and that 's why we have a history
we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift
i call this ability collective learning it 's what makes us different we can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history
we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the ice age tundra of siberia tough tough environment into the americas into australasia
each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings then ten thousand years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age humans learned to farm
farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected
and then from about five hundred years ago humans began to link up globally
through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed
and in the last two hundred years something else has happened we 've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels so fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us so
here we are back at the convention center we 've been on a journey a return journey of thirteen point seven billion years i hope you agree that this is a powerful story and it 's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings
collective learning is a very very powerful force and it 's not clear that we humans are in charge of it
i remember very vividly as a child growing up in england living through the cuban missile crisis for a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction
and the same weapons are still here and they are still armed
if we avoid that trap others are waiting for us we 're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last ten thousand years
so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally this is what i want
i want my grandson daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world
to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us
and that 's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world
we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as daniel and his generation
face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet i thank you for your attention a video
