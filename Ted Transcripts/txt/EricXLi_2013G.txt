shanghai at the height of the cultural revolution
my grandmother tells me that she heard the sound of gunfire along with my first cries
when i was growing up i was told a story
that explained all i ever needed to know about humanity it went like this all human societies develop in linear progression beginning with primitive society then slave society feudalism capitalism socialism and finally guess where we end up communism
all of humanity regardless of culture language nationality will arrive at this final stage of political and social development the entire world 's peoples will be unified in this paradise on earth and live happily ever after
but before we get there we 're engaged in a struggle between good and evil the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism and the good shall triumph that of course was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of karl marx and the chinese bought it
we were taught that grand story day in and day out it became part of us and we believed in it the story was a bestseller
now as i was coming of age something else happened as if one big story wasn 't enough i was told another one this one was just as grand it also claims that all human societies develop in a linear progression towards a singular end this one went as follows
all societies regardless of culture be it christian muslim confucian
must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units and all these individuals are by definition rational and they all want one thing the vote
because they are all rational once given the vote they produce good government and live happily ever after paradise on earth again
this story also became a bestseller
according to freedom house the number of democracies went from forty five in one thousand nine hundred and seventy to one hundred and fifteen in two thousand and ten in the last twenty years western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus
multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long suffering developing world those who buy the prospectus are destined for success those who do not are doomed to fail
but this time the chinese didn 't buy it fool me once
six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty eighty percent of the entire world 's poverty alleviation during that period happened in china in other words all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single one party state did without voting
see i grew up on this stuff food stamps meat was rationed to a few hundred grams per person per month at one point needless to say i ate all my grandmother 's portions
so i asked myself what 's wrong with this picture
here i am in my hometown my business growing leaps and bounds entrepreneurs are starting companies every day middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history yet according to the grand story none of this should be happening
so i went and did the only thing i could i studied it yes china is a one party state run by the chinese communist party the party and they don 't hold elections
three assumptions are made by the dominant political theories of our time such a system is operationally rigid politically closed and morally illegitimate well the assumptions are wrong the opposites are true
adaptability meritocracy and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of china 's one party system
in sixty four years of running the largest country in the world the range of the party 's policies has been wider than any other country in recent memory
from radical land collectivization to the great leap forward then privatization of farmland
then the cultural revolution then deng xiaoping 's market reform then successor jiang zemin took the giant political step of opening up party membership to private businesspeople something unimaginable during mao 's rule so the party self corrects in rather dramatic fashions
institutionally new rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions for example term limits
political leaders used to retain their positions for life and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules mao was the father of modern china yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes so the party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of sixty eight to seventy
one thing we often hear is political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms and china is in dire need of political reform
but this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias see some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see and only such changes can be called political reform
the truth is political reforms have never stopped compared with thirty years ago twenty years even ten years ago every aspect of chinese society how the country is governed from the most local level to the highest center are unrecognizable today
now such changes are simply not possible without political reforms of the most fundamental kind now i would venture to suggest the party is the world 's leading expert in political reform
the second assumption is that in a one party state power gets concentrated in the hands of the few and bad governance and corruption follow indeed corruption is a big problem but let 's first look at the larger context now this may be counterintuitive to you
the party happens to be one of the most meritocratic political institutions in the world today
china 's highest ruling body the politburo has twenty five members in the most recent one only five of them came from a background of privilege so called princelings
the other twenty including the president and the premier came from entirely ordinary backgrounds in the larger central committee of three hundred or more the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller
the vast majority of senior chinese leaders worked and competed their way to the top compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries i think you 'll find the party being near the top in upward mobility
the question then is how could that be possible in a system run by one party
now we come to a powerful political institution little known to westerners the party 's organization department the department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations
it operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components civil service state owned enterprises and social organizations like a university or a community program
they form separate yet integrated career paths for chinese officials they recruit college grads into entry level positions in all three tracks and they start from the bottom called keyuan clerk then they could get promoted through four increasingly elite ranks the
in two thousand and twelve there were nine hundred thousand fuke and ke levels six hundred thousand fuchu and chu levels and only forty thousand fuju and ju levels
after the ju levels the best few move further up several more ranks and eventually make it to the central committee the process takes two to three decades does patronage play a role yes of course but merit remains the fundamental driver
in essence the organization department runs a modernized version of china 's centuries old mentoring system
george w bush remember him
this is not a put down
now westerners always assume that
multi party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy i was asked once the party wasn 't voted in by election where is the source of legitimacy i said how about competency we all know the facts
in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine when the party took power china was mired in civil wars dismembered by foreign aggression average life expectancy at that time forty one years old today it 's the second largest economy in the world an industrial powerhouse
and its people live in increasing prosperity pew research polls chinese public attitudes and here are the numbers in recent years satisfaction with the direction of the country eighty five percent those who think they 're better off than five years ago seventy percent
those who expect the future to be better a whopping eighty two percent
financial times polls global youth attitudes and these numbers brand new just came from last week ninety three percent of china 's generation y are optimistic about their country 's future now if this is not legitimacy i 'm not sure what is
in contrast most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance i don 't need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is from washington to european capitals
with a few exceptions the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife governments get elected and then they fall below fifty percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election
democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret
at this rate i 'm afraid it is democracy not china 's one party system that is in danger of losing legitimacy
now i don 't want to create the misimpression that china 's hunky dory on the way to some kind of superpowerdom the country faces enormous challenges
corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy but most analysts misdiagnose the disease they say that corruption is the result of the one party system and therefore in order to cure it you have to do away with the entire system but a more careful look would tell us otherwise
transparency international ranks china between seventy and eighty in recent years among one hundred and seventy countries and it 's been moving up india the largest democracy in the world ninety four and dropping
for the hundred or so countries that are ranked below china more than half of them are electoral democracies so if election is the panacea for corruption how come these countries can 't fix it
now i 'm a venture capitalist i make bets it wouldn 't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions so here they are
in the next ten years china will surpass the u s and become the largest economy in the world income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries
that is at the heart of the west 's current ills
if they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others and a little bit more on political reform at home they might give their democracy a better chance
china 's political model will never supplant electoral democracy because unlike the latter it doesn 't pretend to be universal it cannot be exported but that is the point precisely
the significance of china 's example is not that it provides an alternative but the demonstration that alternatives exist
let us draw to a close this era of meta narratives communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over
it is wrong it is irresponsible and worst of all it is boring
let universality make way for plurality perhaps a more interesting age is upon us are we brave enough to welcome it thank you
oversight or consultation decides what the national interest is what is the mechanism in the chinese model that allows people to say actually the national interest as you defined it is wrong
do you know who their biggest client is the chinese government
not just from the central government
the city government the provincial government to the most local neighborhood districts they conduct surveys all the time are you happy with the garbage collection
are you happy with the general direction of the country so there is in china there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people my point is i think we should get unstuck from the thinking that there 's only one political system election election election that could make it responsive
and you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in china
but then you 've just mentioned other elements like you know big challenges and there are of course a lot of other data that go in a different direction tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests etc so
you seem to suggest the chinese model doesn 't have a space outside of the party for civil society to express itself
