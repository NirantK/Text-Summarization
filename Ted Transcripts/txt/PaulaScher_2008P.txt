my work is play and i play when i design i even looked it up in the dictionary to make sure that i actually do that and the definition of play number one was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor
and number two was gambling and i realize i do both when i'm designing i'm both a kid and i'm gambling all the time
and i think that if you're not there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in if you're a designer but the serious part is what threw me and i
couldn't quite get a handle on it until i remembered an essay and it's an essay i read thirty years
was written by russell baker who used to write an observer column in the new york times he 's a wonderful humorist and i'm going to read you this essay or an excerpt from it because it
hit home for me here is a letter of friendly advice be serious it says what it means of course is be solemn
being solemn is easy being serious is hard children almost always begin by being serious which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class adults on the whole are solemn
in politics the rare candidate who is serious like adlai stevenson is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn like eisenhower that's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness which is rare
but more comfortable to endorse solemnity which is commonplace jogging which is commonplace and widely accepted as good for you is solemn
poker is serious washington d c is solemn new york is serious going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future
is solemn taking a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing tiffany 's is serious
now when i apply russell baker 's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality
solemn design is often important and very effective design solemn design is also socially correct
and is accepted by appropriate audiences it's what right thinking designers and all the clients are striving for serious design serious play is something else
for one thing it often happens spontaneously intuitively
accidentally or incidentally it can be achieved out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness but mostly it's achieved through all those kind of crazy
often quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view that's because the art of serious play is about invention change
not perfection perfection happens during solemn play now i always saw design careers
are very short and you make huge discoveries you sort of leap up very quickly in your youth that's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there as you get older the risers get shallower and the steps get wider
and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion
i find it's actually getting really hard to be serious i'm hired to be solemn but i find more and more that i'm solemn when i don't have to be
and what the way i looked at design and the way i looked at the world was what was going on around me and the things that came at the time i walked into design were the enemy
i really really really hated the typeface helvetica i thought the typeface helvetica
when i was in my college days this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular this is actually quite a lovely book jacket by rudi de harra but i just hated it because it was designed with helvetica and i made parodies about it i just thought it was you know completely boring
so so my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of helvetica and to do stuff that wasn't made out of helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find
and there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early seventies there weren't there wasn't a plethora of design publishing you actually had to go to antique stores you had to go to europe you had to go places and find the stuff and what i responded to
you know art nouveau or deco or victorian typography
or things that were just completely not helvetica and i taught myself design this way and this was sort of my early years and i used these things
in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design i wasn't educated i just sort of put these things together i mixed up victorian designs with pop and i mixed up art nouveau with something else
kind of passion drove me into very serious play a kind of play i could never do now because i'm too well educated and there's
form of youth where you can let yourself grow and play and be really a brat
and then accomplish things by the end of the seventies actually the stuff became known i mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and
people knew them and i was suddenly a post modernist and i began a career as in my own business and first i was praised for it then criticized for it but the fact of the matter was i had become solemn
i didn't do what i think was a piece of serious work again for about fourteen years i spent most of the eighties being quite solemn turning out these sorts of designs that i was expected to do because
that's who i was and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead and getting rediscovered all over
so here was the second condition for which i think i accomplished some serious play
paul newman movie that i love called the verdict i don't know how many of you have seen it but it's a beaut and in the movie he plays a down and out lawyer who 's become an ambulance
and he 's taken on he 's given actually a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal
and in the midst of trying to connect the deal he starts to empathize and identify with his client and he regains his morality and purpose and he goes on to win the case
and in the depth of despair in the midst of the movie when it looks like he can't pull this thing off and he needs this case he needs to win this case so badly there's a shot of paul newman alone in his office
saying this is the case there are no other cases this is the case there are no other cases
and in that moment of desire and focus
a theater director named george wolf who was going to have me design an identity for the new york shakespeare festival then known and then became the public theater
and i began getting immersed in this project in a way i never was before this is what theater advertising looked like at that time this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times so this is sort of a comment on the time
and the public theater actually had much better advertising than this they had no logo and no identity but they had these very iconic
posters painted by paul davis and george wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater and he wanted to make it urban and loud and place that was inclusive
was that i really became the voice the visual voice of a place in a way i had never done before where every aspect the smallest ad the ticket whatever it was was designed by me there was no format
there was no in house department that these things were pushed to i literally for three years made everything every scrap of paper everything online that this theater did
and it was the only job even though i was doing other jobs i lived and breathed it in a way i haven't with a client since it enabled me to really express myself and grow
and i think that you know when you're going to be given this position and it's rare but when you get it and you have this opportunity it's the moment of serious play
i did these things and i still do them i still work for the public theater i'm on their board and i still am involved with it the
but something happened to it and what happened to it was it became very popular and that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn
and what happened was identity that new york city to a degree ate my identity
because people began to copy it here 's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games
then chicago came out used some more graphics and the public theater 's identity was just totally eaten and taken away which meant i had to change it
so i changed it so that every season was different and i continued to do these posters but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual and they didn't have
of everything being the same thing
now and i think since the public theater i must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions and i don't think i ever i ever grasped
that seriousness again i do them for very big important institutions in new york city the institutions are solemn
and so is the design they're better crafted than the public theater was and they spend more money on them but i think that that moment comes and goes
the best way to accomplish serious design which i think we all have the opportunity to do is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job
that doesn't happen very often but it happened to me in the year two thousand when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design
the insides of theaters with them where i would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings i'd never done this kind of work before i didn't know how to read
an architectural plan i didn't know what they were talking about and i really couldn't handle the fact that a job a single job could go on for four years because i was used to immediacy in graphic design
and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me with add so it was a rough it was a rough
but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because i didn't know what i was
doing i said why can't the signage be on the floor new yorkers look at their feet and then i found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense
they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways they ran around corners they went up sides of buildings
and they melded into the architecture this is symphony space on ninetieth street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and
with fiber optics and the architect jim polshek essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out
and it was serious play this is the children 's museum in pittsburgh pennsylvania made out of completely inexpensive materials
i think my favorite of these was this little job in newark new jersey it's a performing arts school this is the building that they had no money and they had to recast it
and they said if we give you one hundred thousand dollars what can you do with it and i did a little photoshop job on it and i said well i think we can paint it and we did
i hired guys who paint flats
was quite wonderful by the time i did bloomberg 's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted people wanted it in big expensive places and that began to make it solemn
bloomberg was all about numbers and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular led that my partner lisa strausfeld
but it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn
this is a current project in pittsburgh pennsylvania where i got to be goofy i was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood called the north
side and i thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo i think that's rather creepy actually why would a neighborhood have a logo a neighborhood has a thing it's got a landmark it's got a place it's got a restaurant it doesn't have a logo i mean what would that be so i had to actually give
to a city council and neighborhood constituents and i went to pittsburgh and i said you know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town
why don't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations potential installations on
these underpass bridges and stood up in front of the city council and was a little bit scared i have to admit
but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignored the brief
so desperately that i think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just completely because it was so goofy to begin with
and this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak it will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the north side of pittsburgh
and it will probably become a landmark in the area john hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with citibank
that is now a ten year relationship and i still work with them and i actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually
keep their graphics very nice i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting that was the play part of the job
and then i spent a year going to long
showing how the citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth
and it was worth it because they bought this thing and it played out on such a grand scale and it's so internationally recognizable
but for me it was actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until fallon put it on its very good live richly campaign and then everybody accepted it all over the world
so during this time i needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of going to these long idiotic meetings and i was up in my country house and for some reason i began painting these very
very involved laborious complicated maps of the entire world and listing every place on the planet and putting them in and misspelling them and putting things in the wrong spot and completely controlling the information
here 's the united states every single city of the united states is on here and it hung for about eight months at the cooper hewitt and people walked up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say oh i've been here and of course they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot
one of my favorites was this painting i did of florida after the two
thousand election that has the election results rolling around in the water i keep that for evidence
somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery and i had a first show about two and a half years ago and i showed these paintings that
i'm showing you now and then a funny thing happened they sold
one from the series this is a print from the united states which we did in red white and blue we began doing these big silkscreen prints
that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them and i they started to become more political and i picked
areas that sort of were in the news or that i had some feeling about and i began doing these things and then this funny thing happened i found that i was no longer at play i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation
for a show which is not where i started with these things so while they became successful i know how to make them
so i'm not a neophyte and they're no longer serious they have become solemn
and that's a terrifying factor when you start something and it turns that way because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is
that you can push that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about that you can fail with
and that you can be a fool with because in the end that's how you grow and that's all that matters so i'm plugging along here and i'm just going to have to blow up the staircase thank you very much
