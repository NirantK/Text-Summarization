so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet
the eminent scientists of the global footprint network for example calculate that we need about one point five earths to sustain this economy in other words to keep operating at our current level we need fifty percent more earth than we 've got
in financial terms this would be like always spending fifty percent more than you earn going further into debt every year
but of course you can 't borrow natural resources so we 're burning through our capital
or stealing from the future
so when i say full i mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about methodology
what this means is our economy is unsustainable i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant
what i 'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable in other words
economic growth because that 's what will stop economic growth it will stop because of the end of trade resources it will stop because of the growing demand
when we think about economic growth stopping we go that 's not possible because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned
understand the possibility of it not being around even though it has delivered many benefits it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet
and i 'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes that the crazy idea is just that it is crazy and with the earth full it 's game over
the problem is we 're just warming up this growth engine
we plan to take this highly stressed economy
china plans to be there in just twenty years
the only problem with this plan is that it 's not possible
so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly efficient solar powered knowledge based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in two thousand and fifty
a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion
it 's not that it 's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives
it certainly is but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong
see what happens when you operate a system past its limits
is that the system stops working and breaks down
and that 's what will happen to us
many of you will be thinking
but surely we can still stop this if it 's that bad we 'll react
let 's just think through that idea now we 've had fifty years of warnings
pretty much nothing to change course we 're not even slowing down
last year on climate for example we had the highest global emissions ever and recognized
and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for
so when does this transition begin when does this breakdown begin
in fact it 's the system in the painful process of breaking down our system
i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but i won 't because if you want to see it that evidence is all around you
i want to talk to you about fear
i want to do so because in my view the most important issue we face
is how we respond to this question
the crisis is now inevitable
of course we can 't know what will happen
the future is inherently uncertain but let 's just think through what the science is telling us
is likely to happen imagine our economy
when the carbon bubble bursts when the financial markets recognize that to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control
the oil and coal industries are finished
imagine china india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts
generate conflict over food and water
imagine the middle east without oil income but with collapsing governments
imagine our highly tuned just in time food industry and our highly stressed agricultural system failing
imagine thirty percent unemployment in america as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty now imagine what that means for you your family
your friends your personal financial security imagine what it means for your personal security
as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen
imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you so in two thousand and twelve mom and dad what was it like what were you thinking
so how do you feel
we should feel a bit of fear
we are in danger all of us
and we 've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response
but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth
you can 't see the danger at your door but if you look
you can see it at the door of your civilization
that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may panic and hide if we feel it now and think it through we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself
yes things will get ugly
and it will happen soon certainly in our lifetime but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming you see those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem that technology is limitless
is that it takes a good crisis to get us going
when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about
think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult
we are smart in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis
and the good news this one 's a monster
but if we get it right it could be the beginning of civilization instead and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that
in just a few decades
so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required
to my surprise eliminating net co two emissions from the economy in just twenty years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap not very cheap but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization
you can read the details but in summary we can transform our economy we can do it with proven technology we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel
and this is where you come in
when we think about the future i paint of course we should feel a bit of fear
but fear can be paralyzing or motivating we need to accept the fear and then we need to act
we can do this i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do they 're wrong
we can be more we can be much more
we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some ten thousand years ago we 've built a powerful foundation
of science knowledge and technology more than enough
we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society 's evolution
well it 's time to grow up
which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around this century
