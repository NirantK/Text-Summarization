for you are you religious
please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person
let 's see i 'd say about three or four percent i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference
do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way shape or form raise your hand okay that 's the majority
my talk today is about the main reason or one of the main reasons why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way shape or form my talk today is about self transcendence it 's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away
and when that happens the feeling is ecstatic
and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings we talk about being uplifted or elevated
now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor so here 's the metaphor i 'm offering today think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms most of which we 're very familiar with
but sometimes it 's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere
and it opens onto a staircase we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness
in one thousand nine hundred and two the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience
he collected all kinds of case studies he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences one of the most exciting to me is this young man stephen bradley had an encounter he thought with jesus in one thousand eight hundred and twenty and here 's what bradley with arms extended
appearing to say to me
and could with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies so note how
bradley 's petty moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase and on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving
the world 's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase some shut down the self using meditation
others use psychedelic drugs this is from a sixteenth century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god
others use dancing spinning and circling to promote self transcendence but you don 't need a religion to get you through the staircase lots of people find self transcendence in nature others overcome their self at raves
but here 's the weirdest place of all
and after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle here 's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase
i believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy i may fall but i do not
for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life
is that the self seems to thin out or melt away and it feels good it feels really good in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives it feels somehow uplifting
this idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great french sociologist emile durkheim durkheim even called us homo duplex or two level man
the lower level he called the level of the profane now profane is the opposite of sacred it just means ordinary or common and in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals we want to satisfy our individual desires we pursue our individual goals
but sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change
individuals unite into a team a movement or a nation which is far more than the sum of its parts durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group into a moral community
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness and once people circle around some sacred object or value they 'll then work as a team and fight to defend it
durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum of making a group out of individuals
think of the collective anger in tahrir square which brought down a dictator
and think of the collective grief in the united states that we all felt that brought us all together after nine eleven
so let me summarize where we are
i 'm saying that the capacity for self transcendence is just a basic part of being human
i 'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind
i 'm saying we are homo duplex
and this staircase takes us up from the profane level
to the level of the sacred
when we climb that staircase
self interest fades away we become just much less self interested and we feel as though we are better nobler and somehow uplifted
so here 's the million dollar question for social scientists like me
is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design
is it a product of natural selection like our hands
or is it a bug a mistake in the system this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience it 's just a mistake
well many scientists who study religion take this view the new atheists for example argue that religion is a set of memes sort of parasitic memes that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff self destructive stuff like suicide bombing
and after all how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves
how could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self interest
about the evolution of morality where did it come from why do we have it
darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves but they 're of great use to our groups
he wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition he said if the one tribe included a great number of courageous sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other
he went on to say that selfish and contentious people will not cohere and without coherence nothing can be effected
in other words charles darwin believed in group selection
now this idea has been very controversial for the last forty years but it 's about to make a major comeback this year especially after e o wilson 's book comes out in april making a very strong case
that we and several other species are products of group selection but really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection so look at it this way
you 've got competition going on within groups and across groups so here 's a group of guys on a college crew team within this team
there 's competition there are guys competing with each other the slowest rowers the weakest rowers are going to get cut from the team and only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport maybe one of them will make it to the olympics so within the team their interests are actually pitted against each other
and sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys maybe he 'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach
but while that competition is going on within the boat
this competition is going on across boats
and once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat now they 've got no choice but to cooperate because they 're all in the same boat they can only win if they all pull together as a team i mean these things sound trite but they are deep evolutionary truths
the main argument against group selection has always been that well sure it would be nice to have a group of cooperators but as soon as you have a group of cooperators they 're just going to get taken over by free riders individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others let me illustrate this for you
suppose we 've got a group of little organisms they can be bacteria they can be hamsters it doesn 't matter what and let 's suppose that this little group here they evolved to be cooperative well that 's great they graze they defend each other they work together they generate wealth
and as you 'll see in this simulation as they interact they gain points as it were they grow and when they 've doubled in size you 'll see them split and that 's how they reproduce and the population grows
but suppose then that one of them mutates there 's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy it takes advantage of the others and so when a green interacts with a blue
you 'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller so here 's how things play out
we start with just one green and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food
and in short order the cooperators are done for the free riders have taken over if a group cannot solve the free rider problem
then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation
and group selection cannot get started
but there are solutions to the free rider problem it 's not that hard a problem in fact nature has solved it many many times and nature 's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat
for example why is it that the mitochondria
in every cell has its own dna totally separate from the dna in the nucleus
it 's because they used to be separate free living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism
somehow or other maybe one swallowed another we 'll never know exactly why but once they got a membrane around them they were all in the same membrane now all the wealth created division of labor all the greatness created by cooperation stays locked inside the membrane and we 've got a superorganism
and now let 's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free riders of defectors of cheaters and look what happens
a superorganism can basically take what it wants it 's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens from the defectors the cheaters and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms
what i 've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history
darwin 's laws don 't change but now there 's a new kind of player on the field
and things begin to look very different now this transition was not a one time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria it happened again about one hundred and twenty or a one hundred and forty million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple primitive nests or hives
once several wasps were all together in the same hive they had no choice but to cooperate because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives and the most cohesive hives won just as darwin said
and it happened again even more spectacularly in the last half million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures
they came together around a hearth or a campfire they divided labor they began painting their bodies they spoke their own dialects and eventually they worshiped their own gods once they were all in the same tribe they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside
and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet which is human cooperation
a force for construction and destruction
of course human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives
human groups may look like hives for brief moments but they tend to then break apart we 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are in fact often as we 've seen happen in a lot of the arab spring revolts often those divisions are along religious lines
nonetheless when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement they can move mountains
look at the people in these photos i 've been showing you
do you think they 're there pursuing their self interest
or are they pursuing communal interest
which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole
and now i 'm going to give the whole talk over again in three minutes in a more full spectrum sort of way
humans have many varieties of religious experience as william james
but if it is an adaptation then the implications are profound
if it is an adaptation
then we evolved to be religious
i don 't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions those things came along too recently
we unleashed earth changing creativity
nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom but sometimes we
most people long to overcome pettiness
conjured up nearly four hundred years ago
no man is an island
a part of the main jh thank you
