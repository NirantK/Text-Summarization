my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera
but today i want to share with you
the fifteen most treasured photos of mine and i didn 't take any of them there were no art directors no stylists no chance for reshoots not even any regard for lighting
in fact most of them were taken by random tourists my story begins
when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture you know it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger
no one 's ever refused and luckily no one 's ever run off with our camera
back then we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives it 's really become sacred to us this one was taken just weeks after nine eleven
and i found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand
so these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment or even a specific trip
and reflect on our times
and how we change from year to year and not just physically but in every way
because while we take the same photo our perspectives change
and she reaches new milestones
and i get to see life through her eyes and how she interacts with and sees everything
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year
recently on one trip we were walking
and she stops dead in her tracks and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips
and she describes to me the feeling she felt
as a five year old standing in that exact spot
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier
and now what she 's looking at in new york are colleges
because she 's determined to go to school in new york
i don 't know about you but aside from these fifteen shots i 'm not in many of the family photos i 'm always the one taking the picture
so i want to encourage everyone today
to get in the shot
and don 't hesitate to go up to someone and ask will you take our picture
