a sculpture i made which is a
way of kind of freeing a form into
an object that has different degrees of freedom so it
can balance on a point this is a bronze ball an aluminum
arm here and then this wooden disk and the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to and
that would glide easily through your hands the aluminum is because it's very light the bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground
inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle that's
two bearings that pass in between across it like this that counterbalance this weight so it allows it to
roll and the sphere has that balance property that is always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction but
if you put something on top of it it disbalances it and so it would tip over but in this case because the interior is free swinging
in relation to the sphere it can stand up on one point and then there was a second level to this object
which is that it i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon
slightly dangerous normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum but it's
a little bit without um oops so this is just floating floating on a
permanent magnetic field which stabilizes it in all directions except there is a slight tether here which keeps it from
going over the top of its field it's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave and that's what supports the object and keeps it stable
i think we could roll the tape admin i have a sort of a collection of videos that i took of different installations which i could narrate
a sculpture of the sun and the earth in proportion representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two
so here is the earth it's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze and here is a similar sculpture that's the sun at that end and then in a series of fifty five
it reduces proportionately each ball and the spaces between them
get down to this little earth this is in a sculpture park
this one is about the moon and then the distance to the earth in proportion also this is a little
stone ball floating as you can see the little tether that it's also magnetically levitated
and then this is the first part of this is one hundred and nine spheres since the sun is one hundred and nine
times the diameter of the earth and so this is the size of the sun and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the
made up of sixteen concentric shells each one has ninety two spheres this is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist
so this again is on the subject a slice from the equator of the earth and then the moon in the center and it's floating and this is in france
this is in sapporo it's balancing on a shaft and a ball right at the center of gravity or just slightly above the center of gravity which means that the
lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty you can see it rotating here it weighs about a ton or over a ton it's made of stainless steel quite thick
but it's being balanced like that in equilibrium it's susceptible to motion by the air currents
this is another species of work that i do these are these arrays these spheres are all suspended but they have magnets horizontally in them
that make them all like compasses so all the red sides for example face one direction south and the blue side the compliment faces the other way so as you turn around you're seeing different colors
this is based on the structure of a diamond it was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure and then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms and
one more element inside each one of them these were white spheres then i had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres so they would catch
parts of the images and make sort of three dimensional color volumes as you walk through it through the object
this is something i did of a tactile communication system it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture and then putting it into a
this is a clock i designed it has buckminster fuller 's dymaxion map edited here it turns once per day in synchrony with the earth
and then this is like projects that are harder to build
this has a diamond bottomed lake so it's a floating island with water fresh water that can fly from place to place this would be grown i suppose with nanotechnology in the future sometime
in the course of doing my work i sort of have a broad range of interests and some of it is just the idea of creating media
media as a sculpture something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing by just creating the media that the sculpture is
of and i had a lot of
under the influence of thinking about buckminster fuller 's grand project for an electric globe across from the united nations and
mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites so if we could roll the next film here
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations but this the current version of it is a flying airship
about thirty five meters in diameter about one hundred and ten feet in diameter the whole surface of it is covered with sixty million diodes red blue and green
that allow you to have a high resolution picture visible in daylight i came with a plan i brought it to paul maccready 's company
to do a feasibility study and they analyzed it and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen this is the control room inside of
the ship the idea of this air genius it's something that can just transform and become anything it's like a traveling show it has speakers on it and it has cameras
over the surface of it so it can see its environment and then it can mimic its environment and disappear here the legs are retracting the cabin is open or closed as you like it weighs about
twenty tons it has on board generators it can generate about a million kilowatts in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show it really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting there would be on board a crew of artists musicians that would allow the thing to become
actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment and to interact as an entity that was
aware that could communicate it's completely silent and nonpolluting it has electric motors with a novel propulsion system
ways primarily i would be interested in how it would interact with say going to a college campus and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences
the world the situation of the globe the default image on the object would probably be a high resolution earth image but the one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or
global warming issues or migrations all of the things that we're concerned with today and then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave
situation where the people could cut loose and the music and the lights and everything so it could land in a park for example or this could represent a
be able to be an open code so people could interact with it it would be forum for people 's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type
so that's pretty much it okay thank you
