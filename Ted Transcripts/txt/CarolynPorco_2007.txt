in the next eighteen minutes i'm going to take you on a journey and
it's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some fifty years ago when humans first stepped off our planet and in those fifty years not only did we literally physically
set foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets all eight of them and
we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto the body formerly known as a planet
and all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey a voyage to
understand something to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how
earth our planet and we living on it came to be and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this
and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early nineteen eighties but our investigations of saturn
have become far more in depth and detailed since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years
now the saturn system is a rich planetary system it offers mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach
just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here 's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest
is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the inter connectiveness of everything around us
and also how humans fit into that picture and it pains me that i can't tell you all that we have learned with cassini
show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply don't have the time so i'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of
this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn and have been for the past two and a half years saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across
to as big across as the us most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of saturn in fact show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with
and then here 's saturn showing the rings edge on showing you just how vertically thin they are with the moon enceladus now two of the forty seven moons that saturn has are standouts and those are titan
and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system
and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets it has a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like
the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room
except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down
and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it's completely global and enveloping
titan and that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with cassini
over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent
the titan equivalent of tar or oil or what we didn't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane can be
it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth it's a condensable in the atmosphere and so
ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some three hundred and fifty degrees below zero fahrenheit
but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth it carves gullies
it forms rivers and cataracts it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters
it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it's dark
high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth it's cold it's eerie it's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint
that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can tell you that what we have found
on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like for cassini people it has been like a jules verne adventure come true
as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere this is a picture of titan back lit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop
and yet another moon there i don't even know which one it is it's a very extensive atmosphere we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere
and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we couldn't make out what we were seeing on titan when you look closer at this region
you start to see things like sinuous channels we didn't know you see a few round things this we later found out is in fact a crater but there's very few craters on the surface of titan meaning it's a very young surface
and there are features that look tectonic they look like they've been pulled apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means there's been a fracture
like a fault and so it's been tectonically altered but we couldn't make sense of our images until six months after we got into orbit
an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini's investigation of titan and that was the deployment of the huygens probe the european built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system
we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan it took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device
of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it is so significant
that in my mind this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the us and europe and sadly that wasn't the case
it was significant for another reason this is an international mission and this event was celebrated in europe in germany and the celebratory presentations were given
in english accents and american accents and german accents and french and italian and dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations is supposed to mean
a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking
to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it
so it was i mean i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional event and it's something that i will personally never forget and you
probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan 's surface from the probe and this is what we saw
and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by
the flow of liquids and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you are looking at a shoreline
was this a shoreline of fluids we didn't know but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at sixteen kilometers this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ok again the shoreline okay now sixteen kilometers eight kilometers this is roughly
an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the us you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan
and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and i'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system
and here is the horizon ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes
and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight so it wasn't fluid that we landed in what
the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat this is an unconsolidated ground
that is suffused with liquid methane and it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of
titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low lying basins and that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no
in our images or even in the huygens images of any large open bodies of fluids where were they it got even more puzzling when we found dunes
ok so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan showing these dunes these are dunes that are one hundred meters tall
this is the saharan desert of titan it's obviously a place which is very dry or you wouldn't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no
bodies of fluid until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the south polar region
of titan it's about the size of lake ontario and then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found
feature here the size of the caspian sea so it seems that the liquids for some reason we don't understand or during at least this season are apparently at the poles of
titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable mystical place it's exotic it's alien
but yet strangely earth like and having earth like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and
is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself and so now we go onto enceladus
is a small moon it's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat
and enceladus is very white it's very bright
and its surface is obviously
with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the motherlode of discoveries on
was found at the south pole and we're looking at the south pole here where we found this system of fractures and they're a different color because they're a different composition they are coated
these fractures are coated with organic materials moreover this whole entire region
the south polar region has elevated temperatures it's the hottest place on the planet on the body that's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took
additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space and when we color code this image to bring out the faint light levels we see
that these jets feed a plume that in fact we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus my team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have
thought about the other results from cassini and we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water
under the surface of enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in order words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail
of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i don't think i need to tell you
that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implications because if we could demonstrate
genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system
then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its thirteen point seven billion year history
right now earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home we've ever known and if
any of you were alert and coherent during the nineteen sixties
we'd forgive you if you
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the sun seen from the other side of saturn
and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings back lit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring
created in fact by the exhalations of enceladus but as if that weren't brilliant enough we can spot in this
beautiful image sight of our own planet
now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue ocean planet in the skies of other worlds and that
and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago and thank you very much
