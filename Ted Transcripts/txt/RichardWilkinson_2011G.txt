the truth of what i 'm going to say i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the french revolution what 's changed is we now can look at the evidence we can compare societies more and less equal societies and see what inequality does
i 'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links i 'm going to be showing you exist but first see what a miserable lot we are laughter i want to start though with a paradox
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income how rich countries are on average and you see the countries on the right like norway and the usa are twice as rich as israel greece portugal on the left
and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all there 's no suggestion of a relationship there
but if we look within our societies there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society this again is life expectancy these are small areas of england and wales the poorest on the right the richest on the left
have less good health than the people at the top
so income means something very important within our societies and nothing between them
the explanation of that paradox is that within our societies we 're looking at relative income
or social position social status where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us
and as soon as you 've got that idea
you should immediately wonder what happens if we widen the differences or compress them make the income differences bigger or smaller
and that 's what i 'm going to show you
i 'm not using any hypothetical data i 'm taking data from the u n it 's the same as the world bank has on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies
the measure we 've used because it 's easy to understand and you can download it is how much richer the top twenty percent than the bottom twenty percent in each country and you see in the more equal countries on the left japan finland norway sweden
the top twenty percent are about three and a half four times as rich as the bottom twenty percent but on the more unequal end u k portugal usa singapore the differences are twice as big on that measure we are twice as unequal
as some of the other successful market democracies
now i 'm going to show you what that does to our societies
we collected data on problems with social gradients the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder
internationally comparable data on life expectancy on kids maths and literacy scores on infant mortality rates homicide rates
proportion of the population in prison teenage birthrates levels of trust obesity mental illness which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction and social
which i shall use over and over again in the data
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems no correlation anymore
we were a little bit worried that people might think we 'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well being
it has forty different components put together by other people it contains whether kids can talk to their parents whether they have books at home what immunization rates are like whether there 's bullying at school everything goes into it here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality
kids do worse in the more unequal societies highly significant relationship
there 's no relationship no suggestion of a relationship
what all the data i 've shown you so far says is the same thing the average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer
on national income and economic growth that 's very important in poorer countries but not in the rich developed world
but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much
i 'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index here for instance is trust it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted it comes from the world values survey you see at the more unequal end
it 's about fifteen percent of the population who feel they can trust others but in the more equal societies it rises to sixty or sixty five percent
and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital
very similar relationships closely related to inequality
i may say we did all this work twice we did it first on these rich developed countries
and then as a separate test bed we repeated it all on the fifty american states asking just the same question do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality
very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust same thing is going on basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the fifty states in that separate test bed
this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year
and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others and again closely related to inequality
this is violence these red dots are american states and the blue triangles are canadian provinces but look at the scale of the differences it goes from fifteen homicides per million
there 's a about a tenfold difference there log scale up the side but it goes from about forty to four hundred people in prison that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime in some places that 's part of it but most of it is about more punitive sentencing
harsher sentencing and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty
here we have children dropping out of high school again quite big differences extraordinarily damaging if you 're talking about using the talents of the population this is social mobility
it 's actually a measure of mobility based on income basically it 's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two
and at the more unequal end fathers income is much more important in the u k usa and in scandinavian countries fathers income is much less important there 's more social mobility
and as we like to say and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here if americans want to live the american dream they should go to denmark
i 've shown you just a few things in italics here i could have shown a number of other problems they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient but there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries
think of the expense the human cost of that
i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points one is that in graph after graph we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones
and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality it 's not just one or two things that go wrong it 's most things
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that if you look at the bottom sweden and japan
but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality sweden has huge differences in earnings and it narrows the gap through taxation general welfare state generous benefits and so on
japan is rather different though it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax it has lower taxes it has a smaller welfare state
and in our analysis of the american states we find rather the same contrast there are some states that do well through redistribution some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax so we conclude that it doesn 't much matter how you get your greater equality as long as you get there somehow
i am not talking about perfect equality i 'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies
another really surprising part of this picture is that it 's not just the poor who are affected by inequality
and in a number of studies it 's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy
this is just one example it 's infant mortality some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic classification and so
it 's anachronistically a classification by fathers occupations so single parents go on their own but then where it says low social class that 's unskilled manual occupations it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle then the
junior non manual going up high to the professional occupations doctors lawyers
the biggest differences are at the bottom of society but even at the top
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally and that seems to be the general picture that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom but has some benefits even at the top but i should say a few words about what 's going on
i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority of being valued and devalued respected and disrespected
and of course those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society
it also leads to status insecurity we worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others whether we 're regarded as attractive clever all that kind of thing
the social evaluative judgments increase the fear of those social evaluative judgments
interestingly some parallel work going on in social psychology some people reviewed two hundred and eight different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones their responses to doing stressful tasks measured
and in the review what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol the central stress hormone
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social evaluative threat threats to self esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress
now we have been criticized of course there are people who dislike this stuff
our data source decides whether it 's reliable data we don 't otherwise that would introduce bias what about other countries there are two hundred studies
of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer reviewed journals this isn 't confined to these countries here hiding a very simple demonstration the same countries the same measure of inequality one problem after another
why don 't we control for other factors well we 've shown you that gnp per capita doesn 't make any difference and of course others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on
what about causality correlation in itself doesn 't prove causality we spend a good bit of time and indeed people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world
is how important chronic stress from social sources
affecting the immune system the cardiovascular system
or for instance the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people
i think the take home message though
is that we can improve the real quality of human life
by reducing the differences in incomes between us suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well being of whole societies and that 's exciting thank you
