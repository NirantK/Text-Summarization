and we used to imagine that someday they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin and if they could they would fly away
if you had asked me ten years ago whether or not we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals i would have told you it 's unlikely
if you had asked whether or not we would actually be able to revive an extinct species i would have said pipe dream but i 'm actually standing here today amazingly to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility actually a modern day reality but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach
maybe not from the insects in amber in fact this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for jurassic park
but from woolly mammoths the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost woollies are a particularly interesting quintessential image of the ice age they were large they were hairy they had large tusks and we seem to have a very deep connection with them like we do with elephants maybe it 's because elephants
share many things in common with us they bury their dead they educate the next of kin they have social knits that are very close or maybe it 's actually because we 're bound by deep time because elephants like us share their origins in africa some seven million years ago
and as habitats changed and environments changed we actually like the elephants migrated out into europe and asia
so the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis which was standing four meters tall weighing about ten tons and was a woodland adapted species and spread from western europe clear across central asia across the bering land bridge and into parts of north america
and then again as climate changed as it always does and new habitats opened up we had the arrival of a steppe adapted species called trogontherii in central asia pushing meridionalis out into western europe and the open grassland savannas of north america opened up leading to the columbian mammoth a large hairless species in north america
and over hundreds of thousands of years migrating back and forth across the bering land bridge during times of glacial peaks and coming into direct contact with the columbian relatives living in the south
and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years during traumatic climatic shifts so there 's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment and doing very very well and there they survive on the mainland until about ten thousand years ago
and actually surprisingly on the small islands off of siberia and alaska until about three thousand years ago so egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands
and then they disappear like ninety nine percent of all the animals that have once lived they go extinct likely due to a warming climate and fast encroaching dense forests that are migrating north
and also as the late great paul martin once put it probably pleistocene overkill so the large game hunters that took them down
fortunately we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in siberia and alaska and we can actually go up there and actually take them out and the preservation is again like those insects in amber phenomenal
so you have teeth bones with blood which look like blood you have hair and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them
so the preservation and the survival of dna depends on many factors and i have to admit most of which we still don 't quite understand but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he 's buried
the depth of that burial the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment will ultimately dictate how long dna will survive over geologically meaningful time frames
so if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process the dna which was once intact tightly wrapped around histone proteins is now under attack
by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime so those bacteria along with the environmental bacteria
free water and oxygen actually break apart the dna into smaller and smaller and smaller dna fragments until all you have are fragments that range from ten base pairs to in the best case scenarios a few hundred base pairs in length
so most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures but a few of them actually have dna fragments that survive for thousands even a few millions of years in time
and using state of the art clean room technology we 've devised ways that we can actually pull these dnas away from all the rest of the gunk in there and it 's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if i take a mammoth bone or a tooth and i extract its dna that i 'll get mammoth dna
but i 'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth and more complicated i 'll get all the dna that survived in that environment with it so the bacteria the fungi and so on and so forth
but we 've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate capture and discriminate the mammoth from the non mammoth dna and with the advances in high throughput sequencing we can actually pull out and bioinformatically re jig all these small mammoth fragments
and place them onto a backbone of an asian or african elephant chromosome
and so by doing that we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an asian elephant
and what do we know then about a mammoth
well the mammoth genome is almost at full completion
and we know that it 's actually really big it 's mammoth
so a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger and most of that is composed of small repetitive dnas that make it very difficult to actually re jig the entire structure of the genome
so having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives the african and the asian elephant
all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with asian elephants about six million years ago so slightly closer to the asian elephant
with advances in ancient dna technology we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that i mentioned
and i just wanted to talk about two of them the woolly and the columbian mammoth both of which were living very close to each other during glacial peaks so when the glaciers were massive in north america the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones and came into contact with the relatives living to the south
and there they shared refugia and a little bit more than the refugia it turns out it looks like they were interbreeding
and that this is not an uncommon feature in proboscideans because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females so large hairless columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies it reminds me a bit of high school unfortunately
we can put that into an enucleated cell differentiate that into a stem cell subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm artificially inseminate an asian elephant egg and over a long and arduous procedure actually bring back
something that looks like this now this wouldn 't be an exact replica because the short dna fragments that i told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did
there 's no climates or habitats suitable well that 's not actually the case it turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of siberia and yukon that actually could house a mammoth remember this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation
so this landscape would be easily able to house it and i have to admit that there is a part of the child in me the boy in me that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again but i do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders whether or not we should thank you very much
don 't go away you 've left us with a question i 'm sure everyone is asking this when you say should we it feels like you 're reticent there and yet you 've given us a vision of it being so possible what 's your reticence hendrik poinar i don 't think it 's reticence i think it 's just that
