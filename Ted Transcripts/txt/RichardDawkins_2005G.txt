queerer than we can suppose the strangeness of science queerer than we can suppose comes from j b s haldane the famous biologist who said
now my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose
i suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of or can be dreamed of in any philosophy
richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories experimental predictions to specifying the width of north america
to within one hair 's breadth of accuracy this means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true
yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even feynman himself
was moved to remark if you think you understand quantum theory you don't understand quantum theory
that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it david deutsch who 's talking here in the fabric of reality embraces the
many worlds interpretation of quantum theory because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful
it postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments and that's richard
the biologist lewis wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense
every time you drink a glass of water he points out the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of oliver cromwell just elementary probability theory
just elementary probability theory the number of
hugely greater than the number of glassfuls or bladdersful in the world and of course there's nothing special about cromwell or bladders
you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree
queerer than we can suppose what is it that makes us capable of supposing anything and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose
are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence are there things about the universe that are in principle ungraspable
by any mind however superior
science has been one long series of violent brainstorms as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe
used to the idea that the earth spins rather than the sun moves across the sky it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must
tell me he asked a friend why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating
his friend replied well obviously because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth wittgenstein replied well what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating
the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium
so it would seem the hardest solidest densest rock is really almost entirely empty space
broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn 't count why then do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable
as an evolutionary biologist i'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at
we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms if we had our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space
rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands precisely because objects like rocks and hands
cannot penetrate each other it's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like solidity
and impenetrability because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate
our brains would be much better at understanding einstein i want to give the name middle world to the medium
we are evolved denizens of middle world and that limits what we are capable of
hits another middle world object like a rock it knocks itself out may i introduce major general
he stared at his wall in arlington virginia and decided to do it as frightening as the prospect was he was going into the next office
and moved out from behind his desk what is the atom mostly made of he thought space he started walking
what am i mostly made
atoms he quickened his pace almost to a jog now
what is the wall mostly made
atoms all i have to do is merge the spaces then general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office
who commanded sixteen thousand soldiers was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall
he has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal who would screw around with an army that could do that that's from an article in playboy which i was reading the other day unaided human intuition
schooled in middle world finds it hard to believe galileo when he tells us a heavy object and
air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant and that's because in middle world air friction is always there
if we'd evolved in a vacuum we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously if we were bacteria constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules it would be different but we middle
to notice brownian motion in the same way our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension
a small insect would reverse these priorities
steve grand he 's the one on the left douglas adams is on the right steve grand in his book creation life and how to make it
is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself we have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all
waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem
but we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in middle world where matter is a useful fiction
a whirlpool for steve grand is a thing with just as much reality as a rock in a desert plain in tanzania
in the shadow of the volcano ol donyo lengai there's a dune made of volcanic ash the beautiful thing is that it moves bodily
it's what's technically known as a barchan and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about seventeen meters per year
it retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns what happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope
on the other side and then as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge it cascades down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole horn shaped dune moves
steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing he invites us the reader
to think of an experience from your childhood something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell as if you were really there
after all you really were there at the time weren't you how else would you remember it but here is the bombshell you weren't
not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you
so really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence if a neutrino had a brain which it evolved in neutrino sized ancestors it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space
we have brains that evolved in medium sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks really for an animal is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival
and because different species live in different worlds there will be a discomforting variety of reallys
what we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world but a model of the world regulated and adjusted by sense data but constructed
from a walking climbing or swimming
a monkey 's brain must have software capable of simulating a three dimensional world of branches and trunks a mole 's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use
a water strider 's brain doesn't need three d software at all since it lives on the surface of the pond in an edwin abbott flatland
i've speculated that bats may see color with their ears the world model that a bat needs
in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird a day flying bird like a swallow needs to perform the same kind of tasks
the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental
bats i even suggested use perceived hues such as red and blue as labels internal labels for
some useful aspect of echoes perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces furry or smooth and so on in the same way as swallows or indeed we use
those perceived hues redness and blueness etcetera to label long and short wavelengths of light there's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength
the point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used rather than by the sensory modality involved
j b s haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell
dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids extremely diluted caprylic acid and caproic acid the only difference you see is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain
guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of
another fatty acid capric acid which is just like the other two except that it has two more carbon atoms
a dog that had never met capric acid would perhaps have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet say
playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before
middle world the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum
that we see as light of various colors we're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us
middle world is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast
we could make a similar scale of improbabilities nothing is totally impossible miracles are just events that are extremely improbable
a marble statue could wave its hand at us the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway
because there are so many of them and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement the marble as we see it in middle world stays
the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time and again and again in this case the hand would move and we'd see it waving at us in middle world
the odds against it of course are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe you still would not have written enough zeros to this day
evolution in middle world has not equipped us to handle very improbable events we don't live long enough
in the vastness of astronomical space and geological time that which seems impossible in middle world might turn out to be inevitable
one way to think about that is by counting planets we don't know how many planets there are in the universe but a good estimate
is about ten to the twenty or one hundred billion billion and that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life 's improbability
could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at if life has arisen only once on any
if if life could i mean life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per or once per galaxy
or maybe only once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here
and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical things like that
if life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe that planet has to be our planet because here we are talking about
and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in one hundred billion billion
i don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that because i suspect that life is quite common in the universe and when i say quite common it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another
how shall we interpret queerer than we can suppose queerer than in principle can be supposed or just queerer than we can suppose given the limitations of our brain 's evolutionary apprenticeship in middle world
i wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand say quantum theory if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood
which had a sort of make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer 's make believe so that they became familiar
on the middle world scale of the stream and similarly a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the lorenz contraction and so on
to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking get children into the way of thinking about it i want to end by applying the idea of middle world to our perceptions of each other
most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are
our hormones are the way they are we'd be different our characters would be different if our neuro anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different
but we scientists are inconsistent if we were consistent our response to a misbehaving person like a child murderer should be something like this unit has a faulty component it needs repairing
that's not what we say what we say and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us which is probably me what we say is vile monster prison is too good for you
or worse we seek revenge in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter revenge which we see of course all over the world today
in short when we're thinking like academics we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers
but when we revert to being human we behave more like basil fawlty who we remember thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night
the reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension dominated
we are evolved to second guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant intuitive psychologists treating people as machines may be
the economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful goal seeking agent with pleasures and pains desires and intentions guilt blame worthiness
when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole
if the universe is queerer than we can suppose is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the pleistocene of africa
or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution or finally are there some things in the universe so queer
that no philosophy of beings however godlike could dream them thank you very much my title
