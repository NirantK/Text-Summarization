on a human dominated planet putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth
this is bad news but perhaps surprising to you it 's also part of the good news we 're the first generation thanks to science to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet earth to support human development as we know it it 's also good news because the planetary risks we 're facing are so large
that business as usual is not an option
in fact we 're in a phase where transformative change is necessary which opens the window for innovation for new ideas and new paradigms this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability on this journey i 'd like to bring apart from yourselves a good friend
a stakeholder who 's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues a stakeholder who refuses to compromise
planet earth so i thought i 'd bring her with me today on stage
to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we 've had over the past ten thousand years this is the living conditions on the planet over the last one hundred thousand years
it 's a very important period it 's roughly half the period when we 've been fully modern humans on the planet we 've had the same roughly abilities that developed civilizations as we know it this is the environmental conditions on the planet here used as a proxy temperature variability
it was a jumpy ride eighty thousand years back in a crisis we leave africa we colonize australia in another crisis sixty thousand years back we leave asia for europe in another crisis forty thousand years back and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase
the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development a thousand years into this period we abandon our
hunting and gathering patterns we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today the mesopotamian culture we invent agriculture we domesticate animals and plants you have the roman the greek and the story as you know it the only phase as we know it that can support humanity the trouble is
we 're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet a quadruple sqeeze which as its first squeeze has
population growth of course now this is not only about numbers this is not only about the fact that we 're seven billion people committed to nine billion people it 's an equity issue as well
the majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority the twenty percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid eighteenth century the majority of the planet aspiring for development having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle a momentous pressure
the second pressure on the planet is of course the climate agenda the big issue where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at four hundred and fifty ppm to avoid
average temperatures exceeding two degrees to avoid
the risk that we may be destabilizing the west antarctic ice sheet holding six meters level rising the risk of destabilizing the greenland ice sheet holding another seven meters sea level rising now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet a resilient planet but unfortunately the third pressure is the ecosystem decline
never have we seen in the past fifty years such a sharp
decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet
one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term in our forests land and biodiversity the forth pressure is surprise
the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm that ecosystems behave linearly predictably controllably in our so to say linear systems and that in fact surprise is universal as systems tip over very rapidly abruptly and often irreversibly
this dear friends poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale we may in fact have entered a new geological era the anthropocene where humans are the predominant driver of change
it 's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change
you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being nitrous oxide methane deforestation overfishing land degredation loss of species they all show the same pattern over the past two hundred years
simultaneously they branch off in the mid fifty s ten years after the second world war showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid fifty s you see for the first time an imprint on the global level
and i can tell you you enter the disciplinary research in each of these
you find something remarkably important the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet the decade when we have to bend the curves
now as if this was not enough to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states separated by thresholds illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system
now the system may gradually under pressure of
climate change erosion biodiversity loss lose the depth of the cup the resilience but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly under a threshold be tipping over
where new biophysical logic takes over
new species take over and the system gets locked do we have evidence of this yes coral reef systems
biodiverse low nutrient hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing unsustainable tourism climate change a trigger and the system tips over loses its resilience soft corals take over and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development the arctic
a beautiful system a regulating biome at the planetary level taking the knock after knock on climate change appearing to be in a good state no scientist could predict that in two thousand and seven
suddenly what could be crossing a threshold the system suddenly very surprisingly loses thirty to forty percent of its summer ice cover and the drama is of course that when the system does this the logic may change it may get locked in an undesired state because it changes color
absorbs more energy and the system may get stuck
in my mind the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation
as a sideline you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic
to be able to control the oil resources now
if we have evidence which we now have that wetlands forests unclear monsoon system the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way
thirty or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time do we have to put the planet into the the pot
you know you don 't want to stand there in fact you 're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing at the foaming slippery waters at the threshold in fact there 's a fence quite upstream of this threshold beyond which you are in a danger zone and this is the new paradigm
which we gathered two three years back recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts is of the past now we to ask ourselves which are the large environmental processes
define a planetary boundary a fence
within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity this work which was published in nature late two thousand and nine after a number of years of analysis led to the final proposition
that we can only find nine planetary boundaries
with which under active stewardship would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space these include of course climate it may surprise you that it 's not only climate but it shows that we are interconnected among many systems on the planet
record of the history of the planet
but we also include what we call the slow variables the systems that under the hood regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet
air pollution including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates but also chemical pollution
together these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the anthropocene understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system in fact most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three musketeers
one for all all for one you degrade forests you go beyond the boundary on land you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable the drama here is in fact that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one
if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries what you see here in black line is the safe operating space the quantified
boundaries as suggested by this analysis the yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point the pre industrial point where we 're very safely in the safe operating space in the fifty s we start branching out
in the sixty s already through the green revolution and the haber bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere you know human 's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole
we don 't transgress the climate boundary until the early ninety s actually right after rio and today we are in a situation where we estimate that we 've transgressed three boundaries the rate of biodiversity loss which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs
nitrogen and climate change but we still have some degrees of freedom on the others but we are approaching fast on land water phosphorus and oceans but this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity to put the light
on our so far overpowered industrial vehicle which
operates as if we 're only on a dark straight highway now the question then is how gloomy is this is then sustainable development utopia well there 's no science to suggest in fact there is
ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm from the current
linear command and control thinking looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible a much more adaptive approach where we recognize that redundancy both in social and environmental systems is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change
we have to invest in persistence in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup
we have to invest in transformations capability moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis and of course to adapt to unavoidable change this is a new paradigm we 're not
doing that at any scale on governance but is it happening anywhere do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level well yes in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer there 's good news here for example from latin america where plow based
leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted
technologies which today for example
the australian great barrier reef is another success story
under the realization from tourist operators fishermen the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime
global change beautification rack culture overfishing and unsustainable tourism all together placing this system in the realization of crisis but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience
and then allow for much more redundancy in the system sweden the country i come from has other examples where wetlands in southern sweden were seen as as in many countries as flood prone polluted nuisance in the peri urban regions but again
a crisis new partnerships actors locally transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning
so crisis leading into opportunities
we cannot continue consuming water as we do today with twenty five percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean
and we need a transformation well interestingly and based on
my work and others in africa for example we 've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers fields and innovations in tillage systems
we can triple quadruple yield levels on current land
local action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations where local
actors together can deal with the global commons at a large scale but even on the hard policy area we have innovations we know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low carbon economy in record time
and what shall we do everybody talks about carbon taxes it won 't work emission schemes but for example one
policy measure feed in tariffs on the energy system which is already applied from china
doing it on offshore wind systems all the way to the u s where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy but you can subsidize electricity to poor people you get people out of poverty you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector while at the same time stimulating innovation examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level
so there is no doubt opportunity here and we can list
our future and we say what is the playing field on the planet what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate and then backtrack innovations within that but of course the drama is it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option so there is scientific evidence
