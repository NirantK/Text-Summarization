and for most of those years i worried about how am i going to sell more cars and trucks but today i worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles
triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles
i literally grew up with the ford motor company
my parents would go to dinner they 'd sit down i 'd sneak out of the house i 'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway and it was a blast and that went on for about two years until i think i was about twelve my dad brought home a lincoln mark iii and it was snowing that day
so he and mom went to dinner and i snuck out and thought it 'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished dinner early that evening and he was walking to the front hall
and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the front hall
so it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while
but cars are really more than a passion of mine they 're quite literally in my blood my great grandfather was henry ford and on my mother 's side my great grandfather was harvey firestone so
when i was born i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me
but my great grandfather henry ford really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people 's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them
because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress and that 's a belief that i share my other great passion is the environment
and as a young boy i used to go up to northern michigan and fish in the rivers that hemingway fished in and then later wrote about
and it really struck me as the years went by in a very negative way when i would go to some stream that i 'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it
and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and the whole notion of environmental preservation at a very basic level sunk in with me as a high schooler i started to read authors like thoreau and aldo leopold and edward abbey
and i really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world
but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict
with nature and that was true until i got to college
and when i got to college you can imagine my surprise when i would go to class and a number of my professors would say that ford motor company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country they thought that we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress
and that we filled the skies with smog
and frankly we were the enemy i joined ford after college after some soul searching whether or not this is
really the right thing to do but i decided that i wanted to go and see if i could affect change there
and as i look back over thirty years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that i could but i wanted to and i really discovered that my professors weren 't completely wrong
in fact when i got back to detroit my environmental leanings weren 't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the industry i had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine
i was considered a radical and i 'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists
and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today i mean i think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues of cars and the environment not only at ford but really as an industry
we 're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights
and with new technology we 're reducing and i believe someday we 'll eliminate co two emissions we 're starting to sell electric cars which is great we 're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word economically socially and environmentally
and actually although we 've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do i can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony
but unfortunately as we 're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as i said we 're not there yet we 've got a lot of work to do but i can see where we will but even as we 're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren 't noticing
and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is the problem put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics
today there are approximately six point eight billion people in the world and within our lifetime that number 's going to grow to about nine billion
and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth
and with that growth comes some severe practical problems
one of which is our transportation system simply won 't be able to deal with it
when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about eight hundred million cars on the road worldwide but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that number 's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century
and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average american spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams and that 's a huge waste of time and resources but that 's nothing compared to what 's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest
today the average driver in beijing has a five hour commute
and last summer many of you probably saw this
there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took eleven days to clear in china
in the decades to come seventy five percent of the world 's population will live in cities and fifty of those cities will be of ten million people or more
so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing when you factor in population growth
it 's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow
frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars
and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam
and our ability to deliver food and health care particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised
so what 's going to solve this
well the answer isn 't going to be more of the same my great grandfather once said before he invented the model t if i had asked people then what they wanted they would have answered we want faster horses
so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads when america began moving west we didn 't add more wagon trains we built railroads
and to connect our country after world war ii we didn 't build more two lane highways we built the interstate highway system
today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public transportation systems and more
we don 't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots
we need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale
without hassle or compromises for travelers and frankly that 's the kind of system that 's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable
now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world
the city of masdar in abu dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets and up above you 've got a series of pedestrian walkways
pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in new york
from about an hour today at rush hour to about twenty minutes now if you look at hong kong they have a very interesting system called octopus there it 's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets
into a single payment system
so parking garages buses trains they all operate within the same system
now shared car services are also springing up around the world
and these efforts i think are great they 're relieving congestion and they 're frankly starting to save some fuel
these are all really good ideas that will move us forward
but what really inspires me is what 's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other
very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network
every morning i drive about thirty miles from my home in ann arbor to my office in dearborn michigan
and every night i go home my commute is a total crapshoot
and i often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we 're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other
so if the car ahead of me on i ninety four hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they 're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon
but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless so just imagine
one day very soon you 're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system
so you get in your car and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest
users of fuel in today 's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in new york city and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don 't have to wait in the cold to hail one
or being at a future ted conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles
into a single system so i think it 's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem
but as we found out with addressing co two issues and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet
the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found i believe in a global network of interconnected solutions now i know we can develop the technology that 's going to make this work
whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven 't even thought of yet
our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support
all the future options we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue companies entrepreneurs venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social problem and just as these groups
embrace the green energy challenge and it 's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought has really over the last three years just poured into the green energy field
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock but we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers i mean frankly i need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue
and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge this isn 't going to be solved by any one person or one group
it 's going to really require a national energy policy frankly for each country because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are
but we need to get going and we need to get going today and we must have an infrastructure that 's designed to support this flexible future
you know we 've come a long way
since the model t most people never traveled more than twenty five miles from home in their entire lifetime
and since then the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around
we don 't want to regress and lose that freedom we 're on our way to solving and as i said earlier i know we 've got a long way to go the one big issue that we 're all focused on that threatens it and that 's the environmental issue but i believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity
and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock
because in doing so we 're going to preserve
what we 've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as i do
a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that 's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow
i believe we 're at our best when we 're confronted with big issues this is a big one and it won 't wait so let 's get started now
