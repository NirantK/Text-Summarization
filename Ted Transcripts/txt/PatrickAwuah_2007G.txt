like many of you here i am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in africa the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership africa can only be transformed
by enlightened leaders and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday
an american friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana and in a period of three months she came
not a candle pitch black the patient 's cut open twice
the first time it was a c section thankfully baby was out mother and child survived
the second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia
he 's praying pitch black not a candle
and that hospital could have afforded flashlights they could have afforded to purchase these things but they didn 't and it happened twice another time she watched in horror
as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had
and so three months later just before she returned to the united states nurses in accra go on strike and her
you see the faults of the ministry of health the hospital administrators
the doctors the nurses they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school
they are the elite they are our leaders their decisions their actions matter
and when they fail a nation literally suffers so when i speak of leadership
i'm not talking about just political leaders we've heard a lot about that i'm talking about the elite
those who 've been trained whose job it is to be the guardians of their society the lawyers the judges the policemen the doctors the engineers the civil
those are the leaders and we need to train them right now my first pointed and memorable
and one day i go to the airport to meet my father and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building
i'm stopped by two soldiers wielding ak forty seven assault weapons and they asked me
to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment why because
the path i had taken was considered out of bounds no sign to this
now i was sixteen i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill i was especially concerned of what the girls might think
and so i started to argue with these men it was a little reckless but you know i was sixteen i got lucky a ghana airways pilot
falls into the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him that they're just following orders so he takes their radio talks to their boss and gets us all released
what lessons would you take from an experience like this several for me leadership matters those men are following the orders of a superior officer
i learned something about courage it was important not to look at those guns and i also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls
so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education it was a breath of fresh air
you know the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as i was used to back in ghana they wanted us to think critically they wanted us to be analytical
to be concerned about social issues in my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of basic economics but i learned something more profound than that which is that
leaders the managers of ghana 's economy were making breathtakingly bad decisions
had brought our economy to the brink of collapse and so here was this lesson again leadership matters it matters a great deal
but i didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at swarthmore i had an inkling
but i didn't fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation
and i was part of this team this thinking learning team whose job it was to design and implement new
created value in the world and it was brilliant to be part of this team it was brilliant
and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore this transformation the ability to confront problems complex problems
and to design solutions to those problems the ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual and i was part of that
while i was at microsoft the annual revenues of that company grew larger than
the gdp of the republic of ghana and by the way it's continued to the gap has widened since i left
now i've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred i mean it's the people there who are so hardworking
persistent creative empowered but there were also some external factors
free markets the rule of law infrastructure these things were provided by institutions
run by the people that i call leaders and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do the work that they do
now while i was at microsoft this funny thing happened i became a parent and for the first time africa mattered more to me than ever before
because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children that the state of the world
the state of the world depends on what's happening to africa as far as my kids
and at this time when i was going through what i call my pre mid life crisis
this was not the world that i'd want my children to grow up in
so i decided to get engaged and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues
and three things kept coming up for every problem corruption weak institutions and the people who run them the leaders now
i was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with and they might say look don't even try but for me i asked the question well where are these leaders coming from
what is it about ghana that produces leaders that are unethical
to solve problems so i went to look at what was happening in our educational system and it was the same learning by rote from primary school through graduate school
very little emphasis on ethics and the average
you know the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong so i decided to engage this particular problem
because it seems to me that every society every society must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders
and ghana was not paying enough attention and this is true across sub saharan africa
africa i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country i think it would make huge difference and what ashesi university is trying to do
the ability to confront the complex problems ask the right questions and come up with workable solutions
i'll admit that there are times when it seems like mission impossible
but we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we
the real issues that they confront that our whole society confronts and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will happen
into this project we'd just started classes and a month into it i come to the office and i have this email from one of our students
and it said very simply i am thinking now and he signs off thank you
it's such a simple statement
i was moved almost to tears because i understood
was happening to this young man and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way thinking now
this year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves there's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now
whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart
can we create a perfect society
her understanding that a student crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection
is incredible now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it
then we can achieve excellence i don't know ultimately what they will do i don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code
but the conversation they're having now about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing time
ok now i just want to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it
i'm very excited about the fact that every student at ashesi university does community service before they graduate
that for many of them it has been a life altering experience these young future leaders are beginning to understand
the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which is after all to serve humanity
i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government
it's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university
says a lot about her
it says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus it says a lot about her peers who elected her she won with seventy five percent of the vote
and it gives me a lot of hope
it turns out that corporate west africa also appreciates what's happening with our students we've graduated two classes of students to date and every single one of them has been
and we're getting great reports back from corporate ghana corporate west africa and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic
you know that passion for what they're doing the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before this is good
this is good because you know
over the past five years there have been times when i've felt this is mission impossible and it's just wonderful to see sort of these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right
i think that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent
with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment
it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference thank you
