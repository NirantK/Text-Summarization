i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age
sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually the first one is dedicated to spencer and his grandmother who was shocked by his work my poem is called
my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap
half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar
all because of a word i said not even said really only repeated but open she says open up her hand clawing at my head
i know now her life was hard she lost three children as babies then her husband died too leaving young sons and no money
she'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet but oh her soap might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet
the street she lived on was unpaved her flat two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me
i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again
she lived to a hundred even then
all along it was the sadness the squalor but i never until now loved her again
when that was published in a magazine i got an irate letter from my
you have maligned a great woman it took some
it took some in those days
those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now
when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block
and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car having worked late again always late
and going heavily down to the cellar to the furnace to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed
those long ago days women my mother my friends mothers our neighbors all the women i knew wore often much of the day what were called housedresses cheap
printed pulpy seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and when you had to go look for a child hang wash on the line
or run down to the grocery store on the corner under a coat the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed dangling beneath
more than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event a ball one would think that never came to pass
more than the way most women 's faces not only were never made up during the day but seemed scraped bleached and with their plucked eyebrows scarily masklike
more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access and boys no conception
only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation that in your dim kitchen your laundry
your bleak concrete yard what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation your real sensual nature veiled in those sexless vestments was utterly your dominion
in those days one hid much else as well grown men didn't embrace one another unless someone had died and not always then
you shook hands or at a ball game thumped your friend 's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection
of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father 's whiskers on your cheek not until mores at last had evolved
and you could hug another man then hold on for a moment then even kiss your fathers bristles white and stiff now
what release finally the embrace though we were wary it seemed so audacious
how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you
we knew so little in those days as little as now i suppose about healing those hurts even the women in their best dresses with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices
even in lipstick and mascara their hair aflow could only stand wringing their hands begging for peace while father and son
like thugs like thieves like romans simmered and hissed and hated inflicting sorrows that endured
the worst anyway through the kiss and embrace bleeding from brother to brother into the generations
in those days there was still countryside close to the city farms cornfields cows
even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests
or you could go out by yourself even to a half block long empty lot
into the bushes like a creature of leaves you'd lurk crouched crawling simplified savage alone
already there was wanting to be simpler
is another longish one about the old and the young it actually happened right at the time we met part of the poem takes place
space we shared and time we shared it's called the neighbor
her five horrid deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window
her cats god knows how many who must piss on her rugs her landing 's a sickening reek
her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door then the door slamming fearfully shut only the barking and the music jazz filtering as it does day and night into the hall
the time it was chris connor singing lush life how it brought back my college sweetheart my first real love
who till i left her played the same record and head on my shoulder hand on my thigh sang sweetly along
of regrets and depletions she was too young for
as i was too young later to believe in her pain it startled then bored then repelled me
my starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire trap in the village that my neighbor was her my thinking we'd meet recognize one another become friends that i'd accomplish a penance
my seeing her it wasn't her at the mailbox gray yellow hair army pants under a
her turning away hiding her ravaged face in her hands muttering an inappropriate hi
come back darlings come back dear ones my sweet angels come back
medea she was next time i saw her sorceress tranced ecstatic stock still on the sidewalk
ragged coat hanging agape passersby flowing around her her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a
silently though as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted a cry so pure practiced detached it had no need of a voice or could no longer bear one
these invisible links that allure these transfigurations even of anguish that hold us the girl my old love
the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party her drunkenly stumbling falling sprawling skirt hiked eyes veined red swollen with
tears her shame her dishonor my ignorant arrogant coarseness my secret pride my turning away
still life on a rooftop dead trees in barrels a bench broken dogs excrement sky what pathways through pain what junctures of vulnerability
what crossings and counterings too many lives in our lives already too many chances for sorrow too many unaccounted for pasts
behold me the god of frenzied inexhaustible love says rising in bloody splendor behold me
her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs one agonized step at a time my holding the door
her crossing the fragmented tiles faltering at the step to the street droning not looking at me can you help me taking my arm
taking my arm leaning lightly against me
her wavering step into the world her whispering thanks love
think i'll lighten up a little
another different kind of poem of youth and age gas
nice i think when the blue haired lady in the doctor 's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts just a little and violently blushes
wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away
besides for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence because not an hour ago while we were on our walk my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking
and that brought back to me the stable i worked on weekends when i was twelve and a splendid piebald stallion who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that though more hugely of course enormous gleaming resplendent
and the woman her face abashedly buried in her elle now reminded me i'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump
the horse would powerfully fart phwap phwap phwap something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured
all that savage grandeur the steely glinting hooves the eruptions driven from the creature 's mighty innards this is called thirst
many most of my poems actually are urban poems i happen to be
until finally one day she vanished
we regarded each other scrutinized one another me shyly obliquely trying not to be furtive
she boldly unblinkingly even pugnaciously wrathfully even when her bottle was empty
i was frightened of her i felt like a child i was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control and i'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench
not excrement merely not merely surface and orifice going unwashed rediffusion of
there was will in it and intention power and purpose a social ethical rage and rebellion despair too though
sometimes i'd think i should take her home with me bathe her comfort her dress her she wouldn't have wanted me to i would think
instead i'd step into my train how rich i would think is the lexicon of our self absolving
how enduring our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished
the dance of our glances the clash pulling each other through our perceptual punctures
then holocaust holocaust host on host of ill injured presences squandered consumed
her vigil somewhere i know continues her occupancy her absolute faithful attendance
the dance of our glances challenge abdication
the perfume of our consternation
the title is this happened
you might fall almost banteringly chides her you might fall
and the young woman eighteen a girl really though she wouldn't think that as brilliant as she is first in her class and beautiful too she's often told
smiles back and leans into the open window which wouldn't even be open if it were winter if it were winter someone would have closed it close it
leans into the window farther still smiling farther and farther though it takes less time than this really an instant and lets herself fall
a casual impulse a fancy never thought of until now hardly thought of even now no
more than impulse or fancy the girl knows what she's doing the girl means something the girl means to mean because
it occurs to her in that instant that beautiful or not bright yes or no she's not who she is she's not the person she is and the reason she suddenly knows
is that there's been so much premeditation where she is so much plotting and planning there's hardly a person where she is or if there is it's not her
or not wholly her it's a self inhabited lived in by her and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing
grace not premeditation but grace a kind of being in the world spontaneously with grace
weightfully upon me was the world
weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself
weightfully this self which weighed upon me the release from which is what i desire and what i
and the girl remembers in this infinite instant already now so many times divided the sadness she felt once hardly knowing she felt it
to merely inhabit herself yes the girl falls absurd to fall even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd
just one more i don't usually say that i like to just end but i'm afraid that ricky will come out here and
this is called old man appropriately enough special
big tits says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand but forget her breasts a lush fresh lipped blond skin glowing gold sprawls there
coming of age in the american sensual darkness never seeing an unsmudged nipple an uncensored vagina
has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye always that erotic murmur i'm hardly myself if i'm not in a state of incipient desire
god knows though there are worse twists your obsessions can take last year in israel a young ultra orthodox rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the shrine of the
forbade them to look in one room because there were images in it he said were licentious
the display was a photo men and women stripped naked some trying to cover their genitals others too frightened to bother lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch
the girls to my horror
averted their gaze what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them even that though
i kept finding myself at her page that she died in the camps made her i didn't dare wonder why more present more precious
died in the camps that too people or jews anyway kept from their children back then but it was like sex you didn't have to be told
and death how close they can seem so
constantly conscious now of death moving towards me sometimes i think i confound them my wife 's loveliness almost consumes me my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds
when we make love her holding me everywhere all around me i'm there and not there my mind teems jumbles of faces voices impressions i live my life over
as though i were drowning
then i am drowning in despair at having to leave her this everything all unbearable awful
to be able to die with no special contrition not having been slaughtered or enslaved and not having to know history 's next mad rage or regression
it might be a relief
no again no i don't mean that for a moment what i mean is the world holds me so tightly the good and the bad
siren seductress how much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows
how she incarnates our desperate human need for regard our passion to live in beauty to be beauty
to be cherished by glances if by no more of something like love
