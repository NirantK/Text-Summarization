and this is our life without bees
but the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally they 're out there because they need to eat
in parts of the world where there are no bees or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand these people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush
now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand held vibrator now this one 's the tomato tickler laughter now this is because
the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower the anther and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it
so bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note c
so they vibrate the flower they sonicate it and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee 's body and she takes it home as food
tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it 's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes so
there 's other maybe more personal reasons to care about bees there 's over twenty thousand species of bees in the world and they 're absolutely gorgeous
these bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees
now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other nineteen thousand nine hundred plus species because there 's something about honeybees that draws people into their world
humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history mostly to harvest their honey which is an amazing natural sweetener
i got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke i was eighteen years old and bored and i picked up a book in the library on bees and i spent the night reading it i had never thought about insects living in complex societies it was like the best of science fiction come true
and even stranger there were these people these beekeepers that loved their bees like they were family and when i put down the book i knew i had to see this for myself so i went to work for a commercial beekeeper a family that owned two thousand hives of bees in new mexico and i was permanently hooked
honeybees can be considered a super organism where the colony is the organism and it 's comprised of forty thousand to fifty thousand individual bee organisms
now this society has no central authority nobody 's in charge so how they come to collective decisions and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor how they communicate where the flowers are all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing
my personal favorite and one that i 've studied for many years is their system of healthcare so bees have social healthcare
so in my lab we study how bees keep themselves healthy for example we study hygiene where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest from the colony and it keeps the colony healthy
and more recently we 've been studying resins that bees collect from plants so bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very very sticky resins off the leaves and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis
we 've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant it 's a natural antibiotic it kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity
humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times we 've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies
for human medicine but we didn 't know how good it was for the bees
so honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over fifty million years
so seven years ago when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse first in the united states it was clear that there was something really really wrong in our collective conscience in a really primal way we know we can 't afford to lose bees
so what 's going on
bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes and i 'll go through each of these the bottom line is bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system
we have half the number of managed hives in the united states now compared to one thousand nine hundred and forty five we 're down to about two million hives of bees we think and the reason is after world war ii we changed our farming practices
we stopped planting cover crops we stopped planting clover and alfalfa which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees
and after world war ii we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival
and we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures now we talk about food deserts places in our cities neighborhoods that have no grocery stores
the very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans
since world war ii we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival
and these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees like almonds fifty years ago beekeepers would take a few colonies hives of bees into the almond orchards for pollination and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein it 's really good for
and they 're trucked in in semi loads and they must be trucked out because after bloom the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape
bees have been dying over the last fifty years and we 're planting more crops that need them there has been a three hundred percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination
and then there 's pesticides
after world war ii we started using pesticides on a large scale and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests
recently researchers from penn state university have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food and they 've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it
and this includes every class of insecticides herbicides fungicides and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient
this small bee is holding up a large mirror how much is it going to take to contaminate humans
one of these class of insecticides the neonicontinoids is making headlines around the world right now you 've probably heard about it this is a new class of insecticides it moves through the plant so that a crop pest a leaf eating insect would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die
if one of these neonics we call them is applied in a high concentration such as in this ground application enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar where a bee can consume in this case a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die
in most agricultural settings on most of our farms it 's only the seed
and on top of everything else bees have their own set of diseases and parasites public enemy number one for bees is this thing it 's called varroa destructor it 's aptly named it 's this big blood sucking parasite that compromises the bee 's immune system and circulates viruses
let me put this all together for you
i don 't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big bloodsucking parasite running around on it and i don 't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus but i do know what it feels like when i have a virus the flu and i know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition
but what if i lived in a food desert
and what if i had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store and i finally got my weak body out there and i consumed in my food enough of a pesticide a neurotoxin that i couldn 't find my way home
and this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death
so what are we going to do
what are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we 've created it turns out it 's hopeful it 's hopeful
every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways plant bee friendly flowers
and don 't contaminate these flowers this bee food with pesticides
so go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them plant them in a pot on your doorstep plant them in your front yard in your lawns in your boulevards campaign to have them planted in public gardens
community spaces meadows set aside farmland we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season from spring to fall we need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife
and we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees
and we need to diversify our farms we need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we 've created
so maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big huge problem just go plant flowers but when bees have access to good nutrition we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services
and when bees have access to good nutrition they 're better able to engage their own natural defenses their healthcare that they have relied on for millions of years
so the beauty of helping bees this way for me is that
every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society an insect society
where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution an emergent property that 's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions
so let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large scale change
on behalf of the bees thank you
this maria spivak yeah at least in the united states an average of thirty percent of all bee hives are lost every winter about twenty years ago we were at a fifteen percent loss so
it 's getting precarious and so they can maintain the same number they can recuperate some of their loss we 're kind of at a tipping point we can 't really afford to lose that many more
we need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there
