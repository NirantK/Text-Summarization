this is the kalandar community they are a marginalized islamic community who live across india and have been in india since the thirteenth century
we went about getting evidence of what was going on and this is footage from a hidden camera in a button and we went in pretending to be buyers and we found this right in this very state in karnataka and the bear cubs were being harvested from across
the country and being sold and traded these were being sold for about two thousand dollars each and they are used for bear paw soup and also being trained later on to become dancing bears like the one you just saw
sadly the family of kalanders depended on this bear the couple are barely eighteen years old they already have four children beside them you can see them
and the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals so we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner
now when we started working deeper and digging deeper we found that it's an illegal act these guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities and what they were doing to the bears was really appalling it was unacceptable
the mother bears are usually killed the cubs which are taken are separated their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod and they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the
now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood to getting something else so this is bitu kalandar who was our first experiment and we were so unsure that this would work we weren't sure at all
and we managed to convince him and we said okay here is some seed fund let 's see if you can get something else and we got the bear surrendered to we set up a sanctuary we have four sanctuaries in india and now he sells cool drinks he 's by the
a telephone booth and then it started there was no turning back after that this is sadua who came and surrendered his bear and now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near agra
then there was no looking back at all for us we gave cycle rickshaws we set up carpet weaving units vocational training for the women the women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society so we were able to address that
so we managed to get education so we sponsor six hundred children education programs today we were able to ensure brighter futures for these people of course we also had to get the bears
and fifty dancing bears we've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears the big news that i want to announce today
is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of india into our rescue center
and india will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries and the people can hold their heads up high
