exploding population small planet it 's going to lead to ugly things but i 'm moving past malthus because i think that we just might be about one hundred and fifty years from a kind of new enlightenment
most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth so a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation maybe depression
but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects
make investing in property a bad bet
in the cities a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value take away land speculation
take away land speculation price of land drops
and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world 's poor
means scarce labor scarce labor drives wages as wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class
now i 'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the black death but look what happened in europe
after the plague rising wages
all of the western religions begin with the notion of eden and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future
so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days but i think we 're in for another change about two generations after the top of that curve once the effects of a declining population start to settle in
at that point we 'll start romanticizing the future again instead of the nasty brutish past
so why does this matter why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away because transitions are dangerous times when land owners start to lose money and labor demands more pay
there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future fear for the future leads to some rash decisions if we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn instead of careening off a cliff
