that would cause me a reticent midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting
and what would you do if you knew what i know
let 's start with how i got to this point
i was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not
difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university and i was really lucky to go to the university of iowa
where i could study under professor james van allen
who built instruments for the first u s satellites
professor van allen told me about observations of venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that venus had an ionosphere or was venus extremely hot
the right answer confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft was that venus was very hot nine hundred degrees fahrenheit
and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere
i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus our instrument took this image of the veil of venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid
but while our instrument was being built
i became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on earth
because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing
eventually i resigned as principal investigator
on our venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important its changes will affect all of humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century warming earth 's surface
i worked with other scientists to analyze earth climate observations
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of zero point four degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co two
that earth would likely warm in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century
we also said that the twenty first century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in north america and asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled northwest passage global warming hoopla
became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because i had complained that the white house altered my testimony so i decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others
to the president 's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels
by then we had two grandchildren
sophie and connor i decided that i did not
so i decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy i gave the talk at the university of iowa in two thousand and four and at the two thousand and five meeting of the american geophysical union
this led to calls from the white house to nasa headquarters and i was told that i could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by nasa headquarters
after i informed the new york times about these restrictions nasa was forced to end the censorship but there were consequences i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks
soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years i was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency
to space so there 's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out until earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun
so the key quantity is earth 's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in
now finally we can measure earth 's energy imbalance precisely
by measuring the heat content in earth 's heat reservoirs the biggest reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until more than three thousand argo floats were distributed around the world 's ocean
these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate
the deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming
the total energy imbalance now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter that may not sound like much
but when added up over the whole world it 's enormous it 's about twenty times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity
it 's equivalent to exploding four hundred thousand hiroshima atomic bombs per day three hundred and sixty five days per year that 's how much extra energy earth is gaining each day
this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce co two from three hundred and ninety one ppm parts per million back to three hundred and fifty ppm
that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming
climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum
in the record when the sun 's energy reaching earth was least
yet there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun 's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth 's climate history
these curves for global temperature atmospheric co two and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over eight hundred thousand years forming a two mile thick ice sheet
as you see there 's a high correlation between temperature co two and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes
slightly lead the co two changes by a few centuries
climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes co two to change not vice versa but that lag is exactly what is expected
small changes in earth 's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth
when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer
a warmer ocean releases co two just as a warm coca cola does and more co two causes more warming
the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as earth warms now because of extra co two we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and co two and methane will be released by warming ocean
and melting permafrost while we can 't say exactly how fast these
unless we stop the warming
there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning
precise measurements by grace the gravity satellite reveal that both greenland and antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year
and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago
methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to the last time co two was three hundred and ninety ppm today 's value sea level was higher by at least fifteen meters fifty feet
where you are sitting now would be under water
most estimates are that this century we will get at least one meter i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even five meters which is eighteen feet
this century or shortly thereafter the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity 's control
ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries there would be no stable shoreline the economic consequences are almost unthinkable hundreds of new orleans like devastations around the world
what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species
the monarch butterfly could be one of the twenty to fifty percent of all
species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change
estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people
the texas oklahoma mexico heatwave and drought last year moscow the year before and europe in two thousand and three were all exceptional events
more than three standard deviations outside the norm fifty years ago such anomalies covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area in recent years
because of global warming they now cover about ten percent an increase by a factor of twenty five to fifty so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not natural they were caused by global warming
an important impact if global warming continues will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world the midwest and great plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the dust bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in ten countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over thirty years
more grandchildren helped me along jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy here at age two and a half years he thinks he can protect his two and a half day old little sister
it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it
with a simple honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed one hundred percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime
most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they 'd pay in increased prices
this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations creating millions of jobs it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future
several top economists are coauthors on this proposition
jim dipeso of republicans for environmental protection describes it thusly transparent market based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices sounds like a conservative climate plan
but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public
to subsidize fossil fuels by four hundred to five hundred billion dollars per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal longwall mining fracking tar sands tar shale deep ocean arctic drilling
this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction
and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world causing massive famines and economic decline imagine
a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now
yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes
if we had started in two thousand and five it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century if we start next year it is six percent per year
if we wait ten years it is fifteen percent per year extremely difficult and expensive
perhaps impossible but we aren 't even starting
so now you know what i know that is moving me to sound this alarm
clearly i haven 't gotten this message across the science is clear
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions
