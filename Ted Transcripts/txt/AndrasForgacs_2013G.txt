but since then much progress has been made both in our lab and other labs around the world and given this we started getting questions like if you can grow human body parts can you also grow animal products like meat and leather
when someone first suggested this to me quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy
but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all what 's crazy is what we do today
i 'm convinced that in thirty years when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags we 'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy
did you know that today we maintain a global herd of sixty billion animals to provide our meat dairy eggs and leather goods
and over the next few decades as the world 's population expands to ten billion this will need to nearly double to one hundred billion animals but maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet
animals are not just raw materials they 're living beings and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land
fresh water and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change on top of this when you get so many animals so close together it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse
clearly we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment public health and food security at risk
there is another way because essentially animal products are just collections of tissues
and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues what if instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal we started with what the tissues are made of
where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs
already in medicine biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts like
ears windpipes skin blood vessels and bone that have been successfully implanted into patients and beyond medicine biofabrication can be a humane sustainable and scalable new industry
and we should begin by reimagining leather
i emphasize leather because it is so widely used it is beautiful and it has long been a part of our history growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal
products like meat it mainly uses one cell type and it is largely two dimensional
it is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators until biofabrication is better understood it is clear that initially at least more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods no matter how delicious
in this sense leather is a gateway material a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry
if we can succeed here it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon
now how do we do it to grow leather we begin by taking cells from an animal through a simple biopsy
the animal could be a cow lamb or even something more exotic this process does no harm and daisy the cow can live a happy life we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions
and we then coax these cells to produce collagen as they would naturally this collagen is the stuff between cells it 's natural connective tissue it 's the extracellular matrix but in leather it 's the main building block
and what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another like phyllo pastry to form
thicker sheets which we then let mature and finally we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process we create leather and so i 'm very excited to show you for the first time
the first batch of our cultured leather fresh from the lab this is real genuine leather without the animal sacrifice
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells and better yet there is no hair to remove
no scars or insect 's bites and no waste this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet a handbag or a car seat it is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator
and because we make this material we grow this leather from the ground up we can control its properties in very interesting ways this piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick and as you can see it is nearly transparent
and this leather is twenty one layers thick and quite opaque you don 't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather and we can
tune this leather for other desirable qualities like softness breathability durability elasticity and even things like pattern we can mimic nature but in some ways also improve upon it
this type of leather can do what today 's leather does but with imagination probably much more what could the future of animal products look like
it need not look like this which is actually the state of the art today rather it could be much more like this
it is where cell culture takes place
imagine that in this facility instead of brewing beer we were brewing leather or meat
or meat imagine touring this facility
learning about how the leather or meat is cultured seeing the process from beginning to end and even trying some it 's clean open and educational and this is in contrast to the hidden guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today
perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind it 's environmentally responsible efficient and humane
it allows us to be creative we can design new materials new products and new facilities
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured thank you
