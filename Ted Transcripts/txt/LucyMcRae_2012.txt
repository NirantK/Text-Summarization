i worked at philips electronics in the far future design research lab looking twenty years into the future i explored the human skin and how technology can transform the body
we transformed our apartments into our
we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution
i set up my studio in the red light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile
i was introduced to robyn the swedish pop star and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion and she talked about how technology with these new feathers this new face paint this punk the way that we identify with the world and we made this music video
i 'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology and i remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology in the future away from disease and aging and i thought about this concept of imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor
modify and biologically enhance it and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other or the way that we attract sexual partners and would we revert back to being more like animals more primal modes of communication
i worked with a synthetic biologist and i created a swallowable perfume which is a cosmetic pill that you eat
and the fragrance comes out through the skin 's surface when you perspire it completely blows apart the way that perfume is and provides a whole new format it 's perfume coming from the inside out it redefines the role of skin and our bodies become an atomizer
i 've learned that there 's no boundaries and if i look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense but when i look towards the future the next project is completely unknown and wide open
i feel like i have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me and it 's these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas and they kind of instinctively come out
as a body architect i 've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever i want and i feel like i 've just got started
so here 's to another day at the office
