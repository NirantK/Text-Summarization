so the natural question you ask then at that point is how do i get good at what i 'm trying to do and it became a question of how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do
it 's hard enough to learn to get the skills
try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you 're taking on i had to think about how i sew and how i cut but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good
in the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine 's existence due to something you don 't normally think about when you 're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people
there 's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do
the political fight that we 've developed has become one around whether it 's the government that 's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem
and the answer is yes
and no it 's deeper than all of that the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us and in order to understand this i 'm going to take you back a couple of generations
i want to take you back to a time when lewis thomas was writing in his book and very ineffective
if you were in a hospital he said it was
going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth some food shelter
and maybe the caring attention of a nurse doctors and medicine
made no difference at all
that didn 't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days as he explained what they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have
one of the diagnoses for which they could do something
and there were a few
you might have a lobar pneumonia for example and they could give you an antiserum an injection of rabid antibodies
to the bacterium streptococcus if the intern sub typed it correctly
if you had an acute
congestive heart failure they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein
giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent
if you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic
as long as you didn 't overdose them and kill them
beyond these sorts of things a medical doctor didn 't have a lot that they could do
this was when the core structure of medicine was created what it meant
to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be it was at a time when what was known you could know you could hold it all in your head and you could do it all if you had a prescription pad
if you had a nurse if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce maybe some basic tools you really could do it all
you set the fracture you drew the blood you spun the blood looked at it under the microscope you plated the culture you injected the antiserum this was
as a result we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring
at being courageous at being independent and self sufficient autonomy was our highest value
go a couple generations forward to where we are though and it looks like a completely different world we have now found treatments
for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have we can 't cure it all we can 't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life
but we can make it possible for most
four thousand medical and surgical procedures
we 've discovered six thousand drugs that i 'm now licensed to prescribe
and we 're trying to deploy this capability town by town to every person alive
in our own country let alone around the world
and we 've reached the point where we 've realized as doctors
we can 't know it all
we can 't do it all by ourselves
there was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital as it changed over time and in the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy it took just over two full time equivalents of clinicians that is to say it took basically the nursing time
we 're all specialists now
even the primary care physicians everyone just has a piece of the care
but holding onto that structure we built around the daring independence self sufficiency of each of those people
we have trained hired and rewarded people to be cowboys
but it 's pit crews that we need pit crews for patients
there 's evidence all around us forty percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care
our experience as people who get sick need help from other people is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to hardworking incredibly well trained and very smart that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope from start to finish
from start to finish in a successful way
in a successful way there 's another sign
that we need pit crews
and that 's the unmanageable cost of our care
now we in medicine i think are baffled by this question of cost we want to say this is just the way it is
this is just what medicine requires when you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin that mostly didn 't do the job
to one where if it gets bad enough we can do a hip replacement a knee replacement that gives you
years maybe decades without disability a dramatic change well is it any surprise
but i think we 're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do
as we 've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased we found that the most expensive care
is not necessarily the best care and vice versa the best care
often turns out to be the least expensive
has fewer complications the people get more efficient at what they do
and what that means is there 's hope
because if to have the best results you really needed the most expensive care in the country or in the world
well then we really would be talking about rationing
who we 're going to cut off from medicare
but when we look at the positive deviants the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs
we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful that is to say they found ways to get all of the different pieces all of the different components to come together into a whole
having great components is not enough and yet we 've been obsessed in medicine with components we want the best drugs the best technologies the best specialists
but we don 't think too much about how it all comes together it 's a terrible design strategy actually there 's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said what if you built a car from the very best car parts
a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes
it 's not a system now a system however
when things start to come together
you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure when you are a specialist you can 't see the end result very well you have to become really interested in data unsexy as that sounds
one of my colleagues is a surgeon in cedar rapids iowa and he got interested in the question of well how many ct scans did they do for their community in cedar rapids he got interested in this because there had been government reports newspaper reports journal articles saying that there had been too many ct scans done
and what he found was that for the three hundred thousand people in their community in the previous year they had done fifty two thousand ct scans
they had found a problem
which brings us to skill number two a system has
skill one find where your failures are skill two is devise solutions
i got interested in this when the world health organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery the volume of surgery had spread around the world but the safety of surgery had not
now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training give people more specialization or bring in more technology
well in surgery you couldn 't have people who are more specialized and you couldn 't have people who are better trained and yet we see unconscionable levels of
and so we looked at what other high risk industries do we looked at skyscraper construction we looked at the aviation world and we found that they have technology they have training and then they have one other thing they have checklists
i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a harvard surgeon worrying about checklists
and yet what we found were that
these were tools to help make experts better we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us could we design a checklist for surgery not for the lowest people on the
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than i had understood you have to think about things like pause points
and then you need to focus on the killer items an aviation checklist like this one for a single engine plane isn 't a recipe for how to fly a plane
it 's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten
or missed if they 're not checked
so we did this we created a nineteen item two minute checklist for surgical teams we had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given immediately before the knife hits the skin immediately before the patient leaves the room
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half and then interesting stuff because you can 't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery
instead you can make a recipe for how to have a team that 's prepared for the unexpected and we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day
that you 're coming in we implemented this checklist
in eight hospitals around the world
deliberately in places from rural tanzania to the university of washington in seattle we found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell thirty five percent
it fell in every hospital it went into the death rates fell forty seven percent
this was bigger than a drug
the ability to implement this to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things
and it 's been slow to spread this is not yet our norm in surgery
let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas
there 's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we 're not a system forces us to behave with a different set of values just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we 've had like humility
i asked him what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles how did you do that and he said we have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around they communicate electronically constantly and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything laughter from
bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle
even the cowboys are pit crews now and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves
making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists but i would go further and say that making systems work whether in health care education
climate change making a pathway out of poverty is the great task of our generation as a whole
in every field knowledge has exploded but it has brought complexity it has brought specialization
and we 've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize
as individualistic as we want to be complexity requires group success
