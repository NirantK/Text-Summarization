've always written primarily about architecture about buildings and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions an architect designs a building and it becomes a place or many architects design many buildings and it becomes a city
and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places at the end of the day you can go and you can visit them you can walk around them you can smell them you can get a feel for them you can experience their sense of place
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world and more and more i was sitting in front of my computer screen
and especially since about two thousand and seven when i got an iphone i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket
and what was surprising to me was how quickly
my relationship to the physical world had changed in this very short period of time you know whether you call it the last fifteen years or so of being online or the last you know four or five years of being online all the time
our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided you know we 're both looking inside the screens and we 're looking out in the world around us
and what was even more striking to me and what i really got hung up on was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own
if you went and looked for images of the internet this was all that you found this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way this infinite expanse where we don 't seem to be anywhere on it we can never seem to grasp it in its totality
so if there was this world and this screen and if there was the physical world around me i couldn 't ever get them together in the same place and then this happened
my internet broke one day as it occasionally does and the cable guy came to fix it and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall
and then he saw a squirrel running along the wire and he said there 's your problem a squirrel is chewing on your internet
protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on
the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it where would it go was the internet actually a place that you could visit could i go there who would i meet you know was there something actually out there
and the answer by all accounts was no this was the internet this black box with a red light on it
as represented in the sitcom the it crowd
normally it lives on the top of big ben
because that 's where you get the best reception but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while
and she looks at it and she says this is the internet the whole internet is it heavy they say of course not the internet doesn 't weigh anything
and i was embarrassed i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for the internet was that amorphous blob or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it it wasn 't a real world out there but in fact it is there is a real world of the internet out there and that 's what i spent about two years visiting these places of the internet
i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit and i visited places like this sixty hudson street in new york
which is one of the buildings in the world one of a very short list of buildings about a dozen buildings where more networks of the internet connect to each other
than anywhere else and that connection is an unequivocally physical process it 's about the router of one network a facebook or a google or a b t or a comcast or a time warner whatever it is connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network
and that 's unequivocally physical and it 's surprisingly intimate
and sixty hudson in particular is interesting because it 's home to about a half a dozen very important networks which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean
if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this
and in this dimension they are incredibly small you can you hold them in your hand they 're like a garden hose but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive as expansive as you can imagine they stretch across the ocean they 're three or five or eight thousand miles in length
and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated the basic physical process is shockingly simple light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that 's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood
and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna and every fifty miles they amplify the signal and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast the basic unit is a ten gigabit per second wavelength of light maybe a thousand times your own
but not only that but you 'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers but you 'll put maybe fifty or sixty or seventy different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber and then you 'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable four going in each direction and they 're tiny they 're the thickness of a hair
and then they connect to the continent somewhere they connect in a manhole like this literally this is where the five thousand mile cable plugs in this is in halifax a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland
and the landscape is changing three years ago when i started thinking about this there was one cable down the western coast of africa represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line now there are six cables and more coming three down each coast
because once a country gets plugged in by one cable they realize that it 's not enough if they 're going to build an industry around it they need to know that their connection isn 't tenuous but permanent because if a cable breaks you have to send a ship out into the water throw a grappling hook over the side
pick it up find the other end and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over it 's an intensely intensely physical process
so this is my friend simon cooper who until very recently worked for tata communications the communications wing of tata the big indian industrial conglomerate and i 've never met him we 've only communicated via this telepresence system which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet
and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables one across the atlantic and one across the pacific and proceeded to add pieces onto them
and then having done that they started to look for places
to wire next they looked for the unwired places and that 's
and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built see you know all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection these sort of brief adjacencies a tweet or a facebook post or an email and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in and i wanted to see that
and simon was working on a new cable wacs the west africa cable system that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa to cote d 'ivoire to ghana to nigeria to cameroon
and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he 'd let me know when and so with about four days notice he said to go to this beach south of lisbon and a little after nine this guy will walk out of the water
then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place then you can see the english engineers looking on and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife
and then once that cable was on shore they began to prepare to connect it to the other side for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station
and first they got it with a hacksaw and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a sort of working like chefs and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down and with this hole punch machine they fuse it together
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology as much as this is an incredibly new thing the physical process itself has been around for a long time and the culture is the same you see the local laborers you see the english engineer giving directions in the background
and more importantly the places are the same these cables still connect these classic port cities places like lisbon mombasa mumbai singapore new york
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days and then when it 's done they put the manhole cover back on top and they push the sand over that and we all forget about it
and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud but every time we put something on the cloud we give up some responsibility for it we are less connected to it we let other people worry about it and that doesn 't seem right there 's a great neal stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires
and we should know i think we should know where our internet comes from and we should know what it is that physically physically connects us all thank you
