with a little experiment could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses
or you've had laser refractive surgery now unfortunately there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly
but it looks like i'm guessing that it'll be about sixty percent of the room because that's
roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction
the world health organization estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses the lowest estimate is one hundred and fifty million people
they also have an estimate of around a billion but in fact i would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now
which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population
and the problem of poor vision is actually not just a health problem
it's also an educational problem and it's an economic problem and it's a quality of life
not very expensive they're quite plentiful the problem is there aren't enough eye care professionals
in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world
just way too few eye care professionals so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about ten thousand people and that's the ratio in the u k
this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub saharan africa in fact there are some countries in sub saharan africa where there's one optometrist for
eight million of the population how do you do this how do you solve this problem i
with a solution to this problem and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself
and that solves the problem what i want to do is to show you that one can make
a pair of glasses i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses i shall put this in my pocket i'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them
so okay i can now see that man running out there and i
okay so i've made these and
made the glasses to my prescription and i've just and i've now
the only pair in the world in fact this technology 's been evolving i started working on it in
and i have a vision which i'll share with you i have a global vision for vision and that vision
to do that this is an early example of the technology the technology is being further developed the cost has to be brought down this pair in fact these
cost about nineteen dollars but the cost has to be brought right down it has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day how do you solve this problem you start to get into detail
and on this slide i'm basically explaining all the problems you have how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing how do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem how
