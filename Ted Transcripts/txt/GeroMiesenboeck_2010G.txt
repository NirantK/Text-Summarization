doctor gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the doctoragonball z android saga
if you look very carefully you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome
so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light that's exactly what i do optical mind control
but in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination my motives are not sinister i control the brain in order to understand how it works
now wait a minute you may say how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first isn't that putting the cart before the horse
many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis
they say if we could record the activity of our neurons we would understand the brain
but think for a moment what that means even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times
would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns and that's so difficult chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that
take a look at what brain activity might look like in this simulation each black dot is one nerve cell the dot is visible
a cell fires an electrical impulse there's ten thousand neurons here so you've looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach
your brains are about one hundred million times more complicated somewhere is a pattern like this is you
your perceptions your emotions your memories your plans for the future but we don't know where since we don't know how to read the
we don't understand the code used by the brain to make progress we need to break the code but how
will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean it's essential to be able to play with them to
will so in this situation too to decode the information contained in patterns like this watching alone won 't do we need to rearrange the
in other words instead of recording the activity of neurons we need to control it it's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain
just some the more targeted our interventions the better and i'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision and since i'm realistic rather than grandiose i don't claim
that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries but we'll certainly learn
now i'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is the history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious
it dates back at least two hundred years to galvani 's famous experiments in the late eighteenth century
galvani showed that a frog 's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current
this experiment revealed the first and perhaps most fundamental nugget of the neural code that information is written in the form of electrical impulses
sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude it's hard to do in animals that run around and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously
so around the turn of the last century i started to think wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down
so instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain re engineer the brain itself
so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light
such an approach would literally in a flash of light overcome many of the obstacles to discovery first it's clearly a non invasive wireless form of communication
and second just as in a radio broadcast you can communicate with many receivers at once you don't need to know where these receivers are and it doesn't matter if these receivers move just think of the stereo in your car
it gets even better for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in dna
each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function
i hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept there's no high tech gizmos here just biology revealed through biology
now let 's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close as we zoom in on one of these purple neurons we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores
like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system but these pores here are special they are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes
a flash of light hits the receptor the pore opens and electrical current is switched on and the neuron fires electrical impulses because the light activated pore is encoded in dna we can achieve incredible precision
this is because although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells
you can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light activated pore and others don 't so in this cartoon
the bluish white cell in the upper left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light activated pore
the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain in this example each electrical impulse each deflection on the trace is caused by a brief pulse of light
and the approach also works in moving behaving animals this is the first ever such experiment sort of the optical equivalent of
it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student susana lima susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
so that just two out of the two hundred thousand cells in its brain expressed the light activated pore you're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you
when you try to swat the fly they trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position
and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect the animal jumps it spreads its wings it vibrates them but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates
now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment she cut the heads off of her flies
stand around and groom excessively so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is
anyway as you'll see in a moment
they didn't get very far obviously since we took these first steps the field of optogenetics has exploded and there is now hundreds of labs using these approaches
and we've come a long way since galvani 's and susana 's first successes in making animals
we can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways as i'll show you in my last example which is directed at a familiar question
life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next we cope with this pressure
having brains and within our brains decision making centers that i've called here the
now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model we constructed a simple one dimensional world for our favorite subject fruit flies
each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down
here 's some such cctv footage whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet it has to make a decision
it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor or whether to cross the mid line and try something new
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor 's policy now for an intelligent being like our fly
this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience we can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model
by assuming that the fly 's brain contains not only an actor but a different group of cells a critic that provides a running commentary
on the actor 's choices you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain 's equivalent of the catholic church
an austrian like me or the superego if you're freudian or your mother now obviously
the logic of our experiment was simple we thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the critic
so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices
they made one of the two choices chose one odor in this case the blue one over the orange one we switched on the lights
if the critic was among the optically activated cells the result of this intervention should be a change in policy the fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced
here 's what happened in two instances we're comparing two strains of flies each of them having about one hundred light addressable cells in their brains
shown here in green on the left and on the right what's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter
but the identities of the individual dopamine producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber
it marches straight through as it did before its behavior is completely unchanged but the behavior of the fly on the left is very different
it comes up to the midpoint it pauses it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out
and then it turns around this means that the policy that the actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber this means that the critic must have spoken in
through many such experiments we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just twelve cells
these twelve cells as shown here in green they send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body which is here in
we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic 's commentary is the actor so this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice
are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air each odor activates a different combination of sensors
which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body so the pilot in the cockpit of the fly
can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue led 's lights up what the actor does with this information depends on its policy
which is stored in the strengths of the connection between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly 's evasive actions
if the connection is weak the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course if the connection is strong the motors will turn on
and the fly will initiate a turn now consider a situation in which the motors stay off the fly continues on its path
and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped in a situation like this we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy
we have created such a situation artificially by turning on the critic with a flash of light that caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the
so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive
i don't know about you but i find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions
and give rise to a physical mechanistic understanding of the mind even if it's the mind of the fly this is one piece of good news
the other piece of good news for a scientist at least is that much remains to be discovered in the experiments i told you about we have lifted the identity of the critic
some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done but we still haven't solved a single example
of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter i think we'll get there in the not too distant future thank you i have a
