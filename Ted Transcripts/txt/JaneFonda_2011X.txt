that 's an entire second adult lifetime that 's been added to our lifespan and yet for the most part our culture has not come to terms with what this means we 're still living with the old paradigm of age
as an arch that 's the metaphor the old metaphor you 're born you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude
they realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance
as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood
and they are asking we should all be asking how do we use this time
how do we live it successfully what is the appropriate new metaphor for aging i 've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject and i have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase
the upward ascension of the human spirit bringing us into wisdom wholeness and authenticity age not at all as pathology age as potential and guess what this potential is not for the lucky few it turns out most people over fifty
feel better are less stressed are less hostile less anxious we tend to see commonalities more than differences some of the studies even say we 're happier
this is not what i expected trust me i come from a long line of depressives
as i was approaching my late forty s when i would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative and i got scared i thought oh my gosh i 'm going to become a crotchety old lady but now that i am actually smack dab in the middle of my own third act
i realize i 've never been happier
i have such a powerful feeling of well being and i 've discovered that when you 're inside oldness as opposed to looking at it from the outside fear subsides you realize you 're still yourself
maybe even more so picasso once said it takes a long time to become young
some of it is a matter of luck some of it obviously is genetic one third of it in fact is genetic and there isn 't much we can do about that but that means that two thirds of how well we do in the third act we can do something about
we 're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference now let me say something about the staircase which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs
entropy means that everything in the world everything is in a state of decline and decay the arch there 's only one exception
to this universal law and that is the human spirit which can continue to evolve upwards the staircase bringing us into wholeness authenticity
and wisdom and here 's an example of what i mean this upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges about three years ago i read an article in the new york times it was about a man named neil selinger fifty seven years old a retired lawyer
who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer 's voice
two years later he was diagnosed with als commonly known as lou gehrig 's disease it 's a terrible disease it 's fatal it wastes the body but the mind remains intact
in this article mr selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him and i quote as my muscles weakened my writing became stronger as i slowly lost my speech i gained my voice
as i diminished i grew as i lost so much i finally started to find myself neil selinger to me is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act
now we 're all born with spirit all of us but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life violence abuse neglect
perhaps our parents suffered from depression perhaps they weren 't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world
perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain a wound perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure and so we can feel unfinished perhaps the task of the third act
is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves for me it began as i was approaching my third act my sixtieth birthday how was i supposed to live it what was i supposed to accomplish in this final act and i realized that in order to know where i was going
i had to know where i 'd been and so i went back and i studied my first two acts
trying to see who i was then who i really was not who my parents or other people told me i was or treated me like i was but who was i who were my parents not as parents but as people
who were my grandparents how did they treat my parents these kinds of things
i discovered a couple of years later that this process that i had gone through is called by psychologists doing a life review and they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person 's life
you may discover as i did that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault
a lot of things you used to think about yourself really had nothing to do with you it wasn 't your fault you 're just fine and you 're able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself you 're able to free yourself
from your past you can work to change your relationship to your past
now while i was writing about this i came upon a book called man 's search for meaning by viktor frankl viktor frankl was a german psychiatrist who 'd spent five years in a nazi concentration camp and he wrote that while he was in the camp he could tell
should they ever be released which of the people would be okay and which would not and he wrote this
everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation this is what determines the quality of the life we 've lived
not whether we 've been rich or poor famous or unknown healthy or suffering what determines our quality of life
is how we relate to these realities what kind of meaning we assign them what kind of attitude we cling to about them what state of mind we allow them to trigger
perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back
and to try if appropriate to change our relationship to the past
it turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this it manifests neurologically
neural pathways are created in the brain you see if you have over time reacted negatively to past events and people neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain and over time these neural pathways become hardwired
they become the norm even if it 's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety if however we can go back
and alter our relationship re vision our relationship to past people and events neural pathways can change and if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past that becomes the new norm it 's like resetting a thermostat
and we become the subjects and objects of other people 's lives but now in our third acts it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started
and know it for the first time and if we can do that it will not just be for ourselves older women are the largest demographic in the world if we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole
this will create a cultural shift in the world and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan thank you very much
