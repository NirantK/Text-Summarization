apparently i was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university
but that 's not the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard anyone say about my work
the most ridiculous thing i ever heard is i was at a dinner party and a woman heard that i work in computer security and she asked me if she said her computer had been infected by a virus and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it that she could get this virus
i 'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get a virus from your computer in a serious way
what i 'm going to talk to you about today are some hacks some real world cyber attacks that people in my community the academic research community have performed which i don 't think most people know about and i think they 're very interesting and scary
and this talk is kind of a greatest hits of the academic security community 's hacks none of the work is my work it 's all work that my colleagues have done and i actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk so the first one i 'm going to talk about are implanted medical devices
and the technology has continued to move forward in two thousand and six we hit an important milestone from the perspective of computer security and why do i say that because that 's when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities
one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney 's device he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart and as you can see at the bottom there it was controlled by a computer controller and if you ever thought that software liability was very important get one of these inside of you
now what a research team did was they got their hands on what 's called an icd this is a defibrillator and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm and these have saved many lives
well in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol and they built the device you see pictured here with a little antenna that could talk the protocol to the device and thus control it
in order to make their experience real they were unable to find any volunteers and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being 's area where the device would go and they stuck the device inside it to perform their experiment somewhat realistically
they launched many many successful attacks one that i 'll highlight here is changing the patient 's name i don 't know why you would want to do that but i sure wouldn 't want that done to me
and they were able to change therapies including disabling the device and this is with a real commercial off the shelf device simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it
and i think this is great but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning there 's a lot of danger in this
okay let me shift gears and show you another target i 'm going to show you a few different targets like this and that 's my talk so we 'll look at automobiles this is a car and it has a lot of components a lot of electronics in it today in fact it 's got many many different computers inside of it more pentiums than my lab did when i was in college
and they 're connected by a wired network
there 's also a wireless network in the car which can be reached from many different ways so there 's bluetooth there 's the fm and xm radio there 's actually wi fi there 's sensors in the wheels that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure to a controller on board
the modern car is a sophisticated multi computer device
and what happens if somebody wanted to attack this well that 's what the researchers that i 'm going to talk about today did they basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network
now they have two areas they can attack one is short range wireless where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby either through bluetooth or wi fi and the other is long range where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network or through one of the radio stations think about it when a car receives a radio signal
it 's processed by software that software has to receive and decode the radio signal and then figure out what to do with it even if it 's just music that it needs to play on the radio and that software that does that decoding if it has any bugs in it could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car
the way that the researchers did this work
is they read the software in the computer chips that were in the car and then they used sophisticated reverse engineering tools to figure out what that software did and then they found vulnerabilities in that software and then they built exploits to exploit those they actually
carried out their attack in real life they bought two cars and i guess they have better budgets than i do
the first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got access to the internal network on the car okay so think of that as someone gets to go to your car they get to mess around with it and then they leave and now what kind of trouble are you in
the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular or something like that never having actually gotten physical access to your
car this is what their setup looks like for the first model where you get to have access to the car they put a laptop and they connected to the diagnostic unit on the in car network and they did all kinds of silly things like here 's a picture of the speedometer showing one hundred and forty miles an hour when the car 's in park
then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars the target victim car and the chase car and they launched a bunch of other attacks
one of the things they were able to do from the chase car is apply the brakes on the other car simply by hacking the computer they were able to disable the brakes they also were able to install malware that wouldn 't kick in and wouldn 't trigger until the car was doing something like going over twenty miles an hour or something like that
the results are astonishing and when they gave this talk even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers everybody was gasping they were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car
the brakes computer the lighting computer the engine the dash the radio etc and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network
they were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car
all of these were implemented successfully
how would you steal a car in this model well you compromise the car by a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software something like that you use the gps in the car to locate it you remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that start the engine bypass anti theft and you 've got yourself a car
surveillance was really interesting the authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car and listening in on the car while tracking it via gps on a map and so that 's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening
they videotaped people on a bus and then they post processed the video what you see here in number one is a
reflection in somebody 's glasses of the smartphone that they 're typing in
they wrote software to stabilize even though they were on a bus and maybe someone 's holding their phone at an angle to stabilize the phone process it and you may know on your smartphone when you type a password the keys pop out a little bit and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing and had a language model for detecting typing
what was interesting is by videotaping on a bus they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing
and then they had a surprising result which is that their software had not only done it for their target but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture they were able to produce what those people had been typing and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their software
one is p twenty five radios p twenty five radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate and there 's an encryption option on these phones this is what the phone looks like it 's not really a phone it 's more of a two way radio
motorola makes the most widely used one and you can see that they 're used by secret service they 're used in combat it 's a very very common standard in the u s and elsewhere
so one question the researchers asked themselves is could you block this thing right could you run a denial of service because these are first responders so would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency
they found that there 's this girltech device used for texting that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the p twenty five and they built what they called my first jammer
if you look closely at this device it 's got a switch for encryption or cleartext let me advance the slide and now i 'll go back you see the difference
so they bought a scanner these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p twenty five
and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in if they found encrypted communication they stayed on that channel and they wrote down that 's a channel that these people communicate in these law enforcement agencies and they went to twenty metropolitan areas and listened in on conversations that were happening at those frequencies
they found that in every metropolitan area they would capture over twenty minutes a day of cleartext communication
and what kind of things were people talking about well they found the names and information about confidential informants they found information that was being recorded in wiretaps a bunch of crimes that were being discussed sensitive information it was mostly law enforcement and criminal
they went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies after anonymizing it and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn 't good enough if you 're talking about something really secure and sensitive it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted that one 's pretty easy to fix the last one i thought was really really cool and i just had to show it to you
it 's probably not something that you 're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators but
it 's stealing keystrokes now we 've all looked at smartphones upside down every security expert wants to hack a smartphone and we tend to look at the usb port the gps for tracking the camera the microphone
but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer the accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone
and so they had a simple setup they put a smartphone next to a keyboard and they had people type and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing to measure the change in the accelerometer reading to determine what the person had been typing
now when they tried this on an iphone three gs this is a graph of the perturbations that were created by the typing and you can see that it 's very difficult to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing but the iphone four greatly improved the accelerometer and so the same measurement produced this graph
now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing
and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
to have a training phase and so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things and to learn to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer
and then there 's the attack phase where you get somebody to type something in you don 't know what it was
now the system is interesting because it produced illinois supreme and then it wasn 't sure the model produced a bunch of options
and this is the beauty of some of the a i techniques is that computers are good at some things humans are good at other things take the best of both and let the humans solve this one don 't waste computer cycles a human 's not going to think it 's the supreme might it 's the supreme court
right and so together we 're able to reproduce typing simply by measuring the accelerometer
why does this matter well in the android platform for example the developers have a manifest where every device on there the microphone etc has to register if you 're going to use it so that hackers can 't take over it but nobody controls the accelerometer
so what 's the point you can leave your iphone next to someone 's keyboard and just leave the room and then later recover what they did even without using the microphone
if someone is able to put malware on your iphone they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iphone next to your keyboard
there 's several other notable attacks that unfortunately i don 't have time to go into but the one that i wanted to point out was a group from the university of michigan which was able to take voting machines the sequoia avc edge dres that were going to be used in new jersey in the election that were left in a hallway and put pac man on it so they ran the pac man game
what does this all mean well i think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly i love the next coolest gadget
but it 's very important and these researchers are showing that the developers of these things need to take security into account from the very beginning and need to realize that they may have a threat model but the attackers may not be nice enough to limit themselves to that threat model and so you need to think outside of the box
