share with you the story as to how i have become an hiv aids campaigner and this is the name of my campaign sing campaign
in november of two thousand and three i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela 's forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four foundation that is his hiv aids foundation and forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island
and that 's me with youssou n 'dour onstage having the time of my life
the next day all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island
where he was going to give a conference to the world 's press
standing in front of his former prison cell you can see the bars of the window there
it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us in that moment in time
mandela told the world 's press
that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country
that post apartheid rainbow nation
a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims the most vulnerable of all
this was a huge impact on my mind because i am a woman
and i am a mother and i hadn 't realized that the hiv aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way
and so i committed when i left south africa when i left capetown i told myself this is going to be something that i have to talk about i have to serve and so subsequently i
talking and using my platform as a musician with my commitment to mandela out of respect for the tremendous unbelievable work that he had done everyone in the world respects nelson mandela everyone reveres nelson mandela
but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa
his country the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there they would be shocked
i was very very fortunate a couple of years later
to have met zackie achmat the founder of treatment action campaign an incredible campaigner and activist i met him at a forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event he was wearing a t shirt like the one i wear now this is a tool this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv
people who are living with hiv and in a way because of the stigma by wearing this t shirt i say yes we can talk about this issue it doesn 't have to be in the closet
i became a member of treatment action campaign and i 'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization
it 's a grassroots campaign with eighty percent membership being women
most of whom are hiv positive
they work in the field they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus they have education programs
they bring out the issues of stigma
it 's quite extraordinary what they do and
yes my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness
so this is my sing campaign sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me i 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years i went to about twelve different countries here i am in oslo in norway getting a nice fat check
singing in hong kong trying to get people to raise money
in johannesburg i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white middle class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart the whole nature of this terrible tragedy that is taking place that people are
tending to avoid because they are fatigued and they really don 't quite know what the solutions are
aaron motsoaledi the current health minister attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change which is absolutely necessary
this is in the scottish parliament i 've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv and i was showing them my experiences and trying to again raise awareness and once again in edinburgh with the wonderful african children 's choir who i simply adore and it 's children like this many of whom have been orphaned because of their
family being affected by the aids virus
i 'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe he 's the director of unaids and i 'm very honored by the fact that michel invited me only a few months ago to become a unaids ambassador and in this way i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach
the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by two thousand and fifteen it 's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will
this can happen and here i am with
pregnant woman who is hiv positive
and we 're smiling both of us are smiling because we 're very confident because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment
so her life can be extended
to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to and her baby will receive pmtct which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus now that is prevention at the very beginning of life it 's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic
now i just would like to finish off
to tell you the little story
she goes with me wherever i go
i tell her story to everyone
because she represents one of millions of hiv aids orphans avelile 's mother
had hiv virus she died from aids related illness avelile had the virus she was born with the virus
and here she is at seven years old weighing no more than a one year old baby at this point in her life she 's suffering with full blown aids and
they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her
and we didn 't know when we left the hospital because we filmed her story we didn 't know if she was going to survive so it was obviously it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience this one child you know that story to meet avelile again
and i 'm getting the hairs on my i don 't know if you can see the hairs on my arms they 're standing up because i know what i 'm going to show you this is the transformation that took place
that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation so
i would like to say to you each one in the audience if you feel
that every mother and every child in the world
has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care and you believe that the millennium development goals specifically five and six should be
absolutely committed to by all governments around the world especially in sub saharan africa could you please stand up
