began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature and which doesn 't get priced by the markets
a project called teeb was started in two thousand and seven and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the g eight plus five and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern they asked themselves a question
biodiversity the living fabric of this planet is not a gas it exists in many layers ecosystems species and genes across many scales international national local community
and doing for nature what lord stern and his team did for nature is not that easy and yet we began we began the project with an interim report which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject
by many many researchers and amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that in fact we were losing natural capital the benefits that flow from nature to us we were losing it at an extraordinary rate in fact of the order of two to four trillion dollars worth of natural capital
this came out in two thousand and eight which was of course around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars so this was comparable in size to that kind of loss we then have gone on since to present
for the international community for governments for local governments and for business and for people for you and me a whole slew of reports which were presented at the u n last year
which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it what is this about
it 's a massive store of carbon it 's an amazing store of biodiversity but what people don 't really know is this also is a rain factory
because the northeastern trade winds as they go over the amazonas effectively gather the water vapor something like twenty billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the la plata basin
this rainfall cycle this rainfall factory effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of two hundred and forty billion dollars worth in latin america
but the question arises okay so how much do uruguay paraguay argentina and indeed the state of mato grosso in brazil pay for that vital input to that economy
and the answer is zilch exactly
we address this invisibility we are going to get the results that we are seeing which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset
it 's not just about the amazonas or indeed about rainforests no matter what level you look at whether it 's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level we see the same problem again and again so rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level
at the species level it 's been estimated that insect based pollination bees pollinating
fruit and so on is something like one hundred and ninety billion dollars worth that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally
or for that matter if you look at the genetic level sixty percent of medicines were prospected were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef once again most of that doesn 't get paid and that brings me to another aspect of this which is to whom should this get paid
that genetic material probably belonged if it could belong to anyone to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule which then became the medicine they were the ones that didn 't get paid and if you look at the species level
you saw about fish today the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods to feed their families
something like a billion people depend on fish the quantity of fish in the oceans a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein and at this rate at which we are losing fish it is a human problem of enormous dimensions a health problem of a kind we haven 't seen before
and finally at the ecosystem level
whether it 's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats or whether it 's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services
we did estimates in our study that for countries like brazil india and indonesia even though ecosystem services these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free
they 're not very big in percentage terms of gdp two four eight ten fifteen percent but in these countries if we measure how much they 're worth to the poor the answers are more like forty five percent seventy five percent ninety percent
that 's the difference because these are important benefits for the poor and you can 't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you 're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset the most important asset which is your development asset that is ecological infrastructure
europe sub saharan africa as we move on and consume
global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us see that again the only places that remain green and that 's not good news is in fact places like the gobi desert like the tundra and like the sahara but that doesn 't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place
this is the challenge the reason this is happening
boils down in my mind to one basic problem which is our inability to perceive the difference
between public benefits and private profits we tend to constantly ignore
public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth it 's common goods and here 's an example from thailand where we found that because the value of a mangrove is not that much it 's about dollar six hundred over the life of nine years that this has been measured
compared to its value as a shrimp farm which is more like dollar nine thousand six hundred there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms but of course if you look at exactly what those profits are almost eight thousand of those dollars are in fact subsidies
so you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it 's more like one thousand two hundred to six hundred that 's not that hard but on the other hand if you start measuring how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use
that answer is more like dollar eleven thousand so now look at the different lens if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits you get a completely different answer which is clearly conservation makes more sense and not destruction
so is this just a story from south thailand sorry this is a global story
and here 's what the same calculation looks like which was done recently well i say recently over the last ten years by a group called trucost and they calculated for the top three thousand corporations what are the externalities in other words what are the costs of doing business as usual this is not illegal stuff this is basically
business as usual which causes climate changing emissions which have an economic cost it causes pollutants being issued which have an economic cost
health cost and so on use of freshwater if you drill water to make coke near a village farm that 's not illegal but yes it costs the community can we stop this and how i think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital basically the stuff of life is natural capital and we need to recognize and build that into our systems
when we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level we don 't include our biggest asset at the country level when we measure corporate performances we don 't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society
that has to stop in fact this was what really inspired my interest in this phase i began a project way back called the green accounting project
calculating this at the national level is one thing and it has begun and the world bank has acknowledged this and they 've started a project called waves wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem services
but calculating this at the next level that means at the business sector level is important and actually we 've done this with the teeb project we 've done this for a very difficult case
which was for deforestation in china this is important because in china in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the yellow river actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society just a year later the yangtze flooded causing something like five thousand five hundred deaths
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation it was associated largely with the construction industry and the chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling
are almost twice as much as the market price of timber so in fact the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china
someone once asked me who is better or worse is it unilever or is it p g when it comes to their impact on rainforests in indonesia and i couldn 't answer because neither of these companies good though they are and professional though they are do not calculate or disclose their externalities
but if we look at companies like puma jochen zeitz their ceo and chairman once challenged me at a function saying that he 's going to implement my project before i finish it
well i think we kind of did it at the same time but he 's done it he 's basically worked the cost to puma puma has two point seven billion dollars of turnover three hundred million dollars of profits
two hundred million dollars after tax ninety four million dollars of externalities cost to business now that 's not a happy situation for them but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say here 's what we are measuring we are measuring it because we know
you could have analysts business analysts and you could have people like us and consumers and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies today we can 't yet do that but i think the path is laid out this can be done and i 'm delighted that the institute of chartered accountants in the u k has already set up a coalition to do this an international coalition
the other favorite if you like solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets and by the way these are my favorites externalities calculation and green carbon markets
teeb has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco certification and you name it but these are the favorites what 's green carbon
today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace it 's about energy emissions the european union ets is the main marketplace it 's not doing too well we 've over issued a bit like inflation you over issue currency you get what you see
which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans more of that in a minute and finally there 's deforestation and there 's emission of methane from agriculture
green carbon which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions and blue carbon together comprise twenty five percent of our emissions we have the means already in our hands through a structure through a mechanism called redd plus a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
and already norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards indonesia and brazil to implement this red plus scheme so we actually have some movement forward but the thing is to do a lot more of that will this solve the problem will economics solve everything well i 'm afraid not
there is an area that is the oceans coral reefs as you can see
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above three hundred and fifty parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species the warm water corals we 're not only risking
five hundred million people who live in the developing world in poor countries so in selecting targets of four hundred and fifty parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations what we have done is we 've made an ethical choice we 've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs
well what i will say to you in parting is that we may have done that let 's think about it and what it means but please let 's not do more of that because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital i don 't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices
