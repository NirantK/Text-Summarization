trying to think how is sync connected to happiness and it occurred to me
we like to dance together we like singing together and so if you 'll put up with this i would like to
and i notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent
you were not organized it didn 't even occur to you to clap in unison
do you think you could do it i would like to see if this audience would no you haven 't practiced as far as i know
can you get it together to clap in sync
so what do we make of that first of all we know that you 're all brilliant
this is a room full of intelligent people highly sensitive
some trained musicians out there
is that what enabled you to synchronize so to put the question a little more seriously let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous synchronization
do you need for instance to be as smart as you are
do you even need a brain at all
i mean that 's a spooky thought right inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves
it 's real in fact i 'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature it extends from the subatomic scale
to the farthest reaches of the cosmos
it 's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we 've all been taught about entropy i mean i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong it 's not but there is a countervailing force in the universe the tendency towards spontaneous order and so that 's our theme now to get into that
birds that flock together or fish swimming in organized schools so
these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we 'll see they exhibit beautiful ballets
we 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony these creatures are not choreographed they 're choreographing themselves
and only today is science starting to figure out how it works
that shows how swarms work there are just three simple rules first all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors
second all the individuals have a tendency to line up and third they 're all attracted to each other
but they try to keep a small distance apart and when you build those three rules in automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks
now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart
birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart but except for that difference
the rules are the same for both
now all this changes when a predator enters the scene
the prey move out in random directions and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again
so there 's this constant splitting and reforming
and you see that in nature
keep in mind that although it looks as if
each individual is acting to cooperate what 's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior
each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers
that is out of the desire to save itself each creature is following these rules and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them even though it looks like they 're thinking as a group
as i say if you 're in a swarm your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced
as compared to a small
there are many eyes to spot danger
sending messages over great distances you 'll see
from that computer model what 's going on as i say it 's just those three simple rules plus the one about watch out for predators there doesn 't seem to be anything mystical about this we don 't however really understand at a mathematical level i 'm a mathematician we would like to be able to understand better
i mean i showed you a computer model but a computer is not understanding a computer is in a way just another experiment we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand
you know exactly where this organization comes from how do the rules give rise to the patterns there is one case that we have begun to understand better and it 's the case of fireflies
if you see fireflies in north america like so many north american sorts of things they tend to be independent operators they ignore each other they each do their own thing flashing on and off paying no attention to their neighbors but in southeast asia places like thailand or malaysia or borneo
there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every night along the river banks the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light
specifically it 's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together
the combined light from these beetles these are actually tiny beetles is so bright that fishermen out
it 's stunning for a long time it was not believed when the first western travelers like sir francis drake went to thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle
no one believed them we don 't see anything like this in europe or in the west and for a long time even after it was documented it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it
to see this kind of spontaneous order and i 've already hinted that the answer is no
well you don 't have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell like take for instance your pacemaker cells in your heart right now they 're keeping you alive every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region the sinoatrial node which has about ten thousand independent cells that would each beep
have an electrical rhythm a voltage up and down to send a signal to the ventricles to pump now your pacemaker is not a single cell it 's this democracy of ten thousand cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly
there is an instance of billions of brain cells or at least millions discharging in pathological concert
so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing
you don 't have to be alive you don 't have to be even a single cell if you look for instance at how lasers work that would be a case of atomic synchrony in a laser what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent many different colors and different frequencies
sort of like the way you clapped initially
but if you were a laser
it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atoms pulsating in unison emitting light of one color one frequency
now comes the very risky part of my talk
which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize
hold your breath for me
what i have here are two empty water bottles
this is not keith barry doing a magic trick this is a klutz
just playing with some water bottles i have some metronomes here
well i shouldn 't advertise anyway so this is the world 's smallest metronome i 've set it on the fastest setting and i 'm going to now take another one set to the same setting
we can try this first if i just put them on the table together
there 's no reason for them to synchronize and they probably won 't
maybe you 'd better listen to them i 'll stand
right they did they were in sync for a while but then they drifted apart
and the reason is that they 're not able to communicate now you might think that 's a bizarre idea how can metronomes communicate
well they can communicate through mechanical forces
so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that i also want to wind this one up a bit
how can they communicate i 'm going to put them on a movable platform okay so
here it is let 's see if we can get this to work
my wife pointed out to me that it will
work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over
right so before any one goes out of sync i 'll just put those right
this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
sometimes has unexpected consequences and a clear case of that was something that happened in london in the year two thousand the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames first river crossing in over one hundred years in london
there was a big competition for the design of this bridge and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team in the ted spirit actually of an architect and an engineering firm
making a blade of light and then scamper across on this blade of light he said that 's the vision i want to give to london i want a blade of light across the thames
so they built the blade of light
and it 's a very thin ribbon of steel
the world 's probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is
everyone was very excited to try it out on opening day thousands of londoners came out and something happened
and within two days the bridge was closed to the public
so i want to first show you some interviews
with people who were on the bridge on opening day who will describe what happened
right so you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways think of the bridge
as being like this platform
think of the people as being like metronomes
now you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do
walk like i mean we oscillate back and forth as we walk and especially if we start to walk like those people did right they all showed this strange
sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move and so let me show you now the footage of the bridge but also after you see the bridge on opening day you 'll see an interesting clip of work done by
a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie
who figured out what happened on the bridge and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was it was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move that engineers knew nothing about actually i think the first person you 'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project
but how could the crowd become synchronized
this was to be the focus of the investigation
allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length
so already the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge am ice skating gait there isn 't all this sort of snake way of walking interviewer for a more convincing experiment i wanted my own opening day crowd the sound check team their instructions just walk normally
it 's really intriguing because
none of these people is trying to drive it
they 're all having some difficulty walking
and the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step but then of course everyone is driving the bridge
you can 't help it you 're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step and therefore to drive it to move
