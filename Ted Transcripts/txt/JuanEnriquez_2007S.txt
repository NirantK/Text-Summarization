is not global warming
bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil it's gas it's
and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo spatial orbits
and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture
so we've been planting stuff for eleven thousand years
and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests you've got to deal with
then you're going to be able to spread beyond the nile
power stuff so irrigation makes a difference irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it as opposed to where the rivers flood
you start getting this organic agriculture
you start putting machinery onto this stuff
machines and water and you get landscapes that look like this and then you get sales that look like
so what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system you start taming that natural system you put a lot of force behind that natural system you put a whole bunch of
up with systems that look like this
so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology
and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me
this is a guy called norman borlaug he won the nobel prize he 's got the congressional medal of honor he deserves all of this stuff
and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds
he did this in mexico the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution
that is something that a lot of people have criticized but of course those are people who don't realize that china and india instead of having huge amounts of starving people are exporting grains
and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research which was mexico didn't adopt this technology ignored this technology talked about
why this technology should be thought about but not really applied and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet
and the institute that this guy ran has now moved to india
that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies
now it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world
that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does if you understand biology look different
the machines were tractors or
stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guy 's doing this is why he 's doing it this is where he 's going
what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and that's where you get your productivity increases
and as you do that stuff
here 's what happens to productivity basically you go from two hundred and fifty hours to produce one hundred bushels
to forty to fifteen to five fifty to two thousand
the rest of the economy increased about two point
this is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person
and fifty percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture
mountains of stuff that people have overproduced
this would be a good outcome for energy
i thought i came to a talk about energy
and here 's this guy talking about biology
so where's the link between these two things
the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand we don't even know what
we don't know where oil comes from
the best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff
that these things absorb sunlight
under pressure for millions of years
and you get these black rivers
the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turns out to be true is that oil
if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isn't ethanol bioenergy is taking the sun concentrating it in amoebas concentrating it in plants
and maybe that's why you get these rainbows
as you're looking at this system
if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight
then bioenergy works in a different way
we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons
as part of these solar panels
maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas
the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look those irrigated plots
this is how you farm oil
and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved we started with this brute force approach
and then what did we learn then we learned we had to go bigger
and then what'd we learn then we have to go even
and we are getting really destructive as we're going out
these are the athabasca tar sands and there's an enormous amount first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here and then you've got to pull out this black sludge which is basically oil that doesn't flow
tied to the sand and then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it which only works at today 's oil prices
so you take something like this you burn it you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this although again i stress we don't know
which is curious as we debate all this stuff
but as you think of coal
this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal
and of course coal mines are very dangerous places
when that gas blows up people die
so you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines but not in others
any place you see a differential there 're some interesting questions
some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff
but again coal maybe the same stuff maybe the same system maybe bioenergy and you're applying exactly the same technology here 's your brute force approach
and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions
which are coal fired gas plants
that is probably not the best use of
as you think of what are the alternatives to this system it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u s is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves
there are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there
and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy or engineering energy we're gonna be in deep doo doo a similar issue
gas is also a biological product
and as you think of gas
and here 's a different way of mining coal
this is called coal bed methane
why is this picture interesting because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life
the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not because there's stuff
that stuff and producing gas
it may turn out that biological processes in coal mines have the same process if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to whole mountaintops
and it may not be to burn coal it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture that is what
it is not ethanol it is not subsidies to a few companies it is not importing corn into iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants
it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly
this is just the beginning stages of this stuff and as you think of biomaterials this guy who did part of the sequencing of the human genome
the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world
has been thinking about how you structure this and there's a series of smart people thinking about
and what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force
think of it in the following terms think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes think of the cell as a hardware think of the genes as a software
and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things
then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way
what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we
this is one of the gentle giants on the planet he 's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met
he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes something called restriction enzymes
he was at hopkins when he did this and he 's such a modest guy
that the day he won his mother called
but anyway this guy is just a class act you find him at the bench every single day
what is this this is the first transplant of naked dna where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species
you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are we're going to start not just
it is very expensive to process this stuff both in economic terms and in energy terms
this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta these are sulfur blocks
because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor
steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it's about fourteen bucks a barrel
that's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks and by the way the scale on these things is pretty large
now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this you reduce the system
and you really do start applying biological principles to energy this has to be a bridge
to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear
and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault
for the next decade at least
the name of the game is hydrocarbons
and be that oil be that gas be that coal
this is what we're dealing with
and before i make this talk too long
here 's what's happening in the current energy system
eighty six percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons that means eighty six percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants
amoebas and the rest of the stuff
how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future
and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells
an enormous amount of money
and leaving most of the energy down
which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy
that is a stupid way of managing this system last point last graph
one of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil
this is what oil prices look like
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else
and then guess what the oil price goes through the floor that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back
so if i had one closing and modest suggestion
stable oil price in europe and the united states
how do you do that well let 's put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax and it basically says for the next twenty years the price of oil will be whatever you want thirty five bucks forty bucks
if the opec price falls below that we tax
if the opec price goes above that the tax goes away
not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as opec drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening is not
