used to be a lot easier to be from iceland because until a couple of years ago people knew hardly anything about us
and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us but in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things first
of course the economic meltdown it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale
was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends including president obama by the way the pronunciation is
of your media got it right
but i'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly i'm here to tell you the story of audur capital which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin who you see in the picture
in the spring of two thousand and seven just over a year before the economic collapse hit why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector
leave to found a financial services firm well let it suffice to say
that we felt a bit
men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems
we decided a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable to found a
based on our values and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance
raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland we weren't known as the typical women women in iceland up until then
it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were
women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then
and we got a great group of people to join us principled people with great skills and investors with a vision and values to
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients and although i want to thank the talented people of our company
foremost for that and also there's a factor of luck and timing we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values so let me share with you our values
we believe in risk awareness what does that mean we believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking and we will not invest in things we don't understand
not a complicated thing but in two thousand and seven it was at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures
it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market
we also believe in straight talking telling it as it is
using simple language that people understand
and although we do work in the financial
where excel is king we believe in emotional capital and we believe that doing emotional due diligence
is just as important as doing financial due diligence
we believe in profit with principles we care how we make our profit so while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our
we are willing to do it with a long term view and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter so we like to see profits plus
positive social and environmental benefits when we invest
but it wasn't just about the values although we are convinced that they matter it was also about a business opportunity it's the female trend and it's the sustainability trend that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men
it is actually about women being different from men bringing different values and different ways to the table so what do you get you get better decision making
and you get less herd behavior and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results
but one has to wonder now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in iceland and by the way europe looks pretty bad right now and many would say that you in america are heading for some more trouble as well
now that we've had all that happen and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables will we see business and finance change will government change
well i'll give you my straight talk about this i have days that i believe but i have days that i'm full of doubt have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us
einstein said that this was the definition of insanity
to do the same things over and over again
hoping for a different outcome
so i guess the world is insane because i see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again hoping that this time
not going to collapse upon us
i want to see more revolutionary thinking and i remain hopeful like ted i believe in people and i know that consumers are becoming more conscious
and they are going to start voting with their wallets and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside if they don't do it from the inside
but i'm more of the revolutionary and i should be i'm from iceland we have a long history of strong courageous independent women ever since the viking
women in iceland took the day off from work or from home they took the day off and nothing worked in iceland
they marched into the center of reykjavik and they put women
the agenda and some say this was the start of a global movement for me it was the start of a long journey but i decided that day to
five years later iceland elected vigdis finnbogadottir as their president first female to become head of state single mom a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breast removed
and at one of the campaign sessions one of her male contenders alluded to the fact that she couldn't become president she was a woman and even half a woman
that night she won the election because she came back
not just because of his crappy behavior but she came back and said
well i'm actually not going to breastfeed the icelandic nation i'm going to lead it so i've had
role models that have influences who i am and where i am today but in spite of that i went through the first ten or fifteen years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman started in corporate america
and i was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual that women and men would have just the same opportunities but i've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that we are not the same and it's great because
we need to start embracing the beauty of balance so let 's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there
let 's start thinking about doing good business that's how we change the world that's the only sustainable future thank you
