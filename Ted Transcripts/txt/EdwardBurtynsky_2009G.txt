and i worked in mines and i realized that this was a world unseen and i wanted through color and large format cameras and very large prints to make a body of work that somehow became symbols
of our use of the landscape how we use the land and to me this was a key component that somehow through this medium of photography which allows us to contemplate these landscapes
that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work and after seventeen years of photographing large industrial landscapes it occurred to me that
oil is underpinning the scale and speed because that is what has changed is the speed at which we're taking all our resources and so then i went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil
what i want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction where we're taking it from the ground refinement and that's one chapter
chapter that i wanted to look at was how we use it our cities our cars our motorcultures where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration
and then the third one is this idea of the end of oil this entropic end where all of our parts of cars our tires oil filters helicopters planes where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up
and to me again photography was a way in which i could explore and research the world and find those places and another idea that i had as well that was brought forward
by an ecologist he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said well how much carbon it would take and how much
for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy from the photosynthetic growth it would take five hundred years of that growth to produce what we use the thirty billion
looking at thirty billion per year we look at our two largest suppliers saudi arabia and now canada with its dirty oil
and together they only form about fifteen years of supply the whole world at one point two trillion estimated reserves only gives us about forty five years so it's not a question of if it's a question of when
peak oil will come upon us so to me using photography and i feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents
our ways of thinking to begin to deal with what i think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time how to deal with our energy crisis
and i would like to say that on the other side of it thirty forty years from now the children that i have i can look at them and say we did everything we possibly humanly could do journey thirty years ago
