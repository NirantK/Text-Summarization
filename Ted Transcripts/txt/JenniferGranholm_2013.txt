three problems three enigmas that i could not solve and i want to share with you those problems but most importantly
i think i figured out a proposal for a solution the first problem
that not just michigan but every state faces is how do you create good jobs in america in a global economy so let me share with you some empirical data from my lab
i was elected in two thousand and two and at the end of my first year in office in two thousand and three i got a call from one of my staff members who said gov we have a big problem we have a little tiny community called greenville michigan population eight thousand
and they are about to lose their major employer which is a refrigerator factory that 's operated by electrolux
and i said well how many people work at electrolux and he said
three thousand of the eight thousand people in greenville so it is a one company town and electrolux was going to go to mexico so i said forget that
i 'm the new governor we can fix this we 're going to go to greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make electrolux an offer they can 't refuse
so i brought my whole cabinet and we met with all of the pooh bahs of little greenville the mayor the city manager the head of the community college and we basically emptied our
pockets and put all of our chips on the table incentives you name it to convince electrolux to stay and as we made our pile of chips we slid them across the table to the management of electrolux and in the pile were things like zero taxes for twenty years or
they would offer unprecedented concessions sacrifices to just keep those jobs in greenville
so the management of electrolux took our pile our list of incentives and they went outside the room for seventeen minutes
and they came back in and they said wow this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here
and when they did it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little greenville in fact they did implode the factory that 's a guy that is walking on his last day of work
and on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line the employees of electrolux in greenville michigan had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper
it was in a big pavilion in greenville an indoor pavilion and i went to it because i was so frustrated as governor that i couldn 't stop the outflow of these jobs
and i wanted to grieve with them and as i went into the room there 's thousands of people there it was a just big thing people were eating boxed lunches on roundtop tables and there was a sad band playing music or a band playing sad music probably both
this guy comes up to me and he 's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on and he had his two daughters with him and he said gov these are my two daughters
he said i 'm forty eight years old and i have worked at this factory
for thirty years i went from high school to factory
my father worked at this factory he said my grandfather worked at this factory
all i know is how to make refrigerators and he looked at his daughters and he puts his hand on his chest and he says so gov tell me
is ever going to hire me
who is ever going to hire me and that was asked
not just by that guy
but by everyone in the pavilion
and frankly by every worker at one of the fifty thousand factories that closed in the first decade of this century
enigma number one how do you create jobs in america in a global economy number two very quickly
number two very quickly lice nickelback the band
so it got me thinking what is it what in the laboratory that i see out there the laboratories of democracy what has happened what policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way
so if i asked you for example what was the obama administration policy that caused massive changes across the country what would you say you might say obamacare except for those were not voluntary changes as we know only half the states have opted in we might say the recovery act but those didn 't require policy changes
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur
was race to the top for education why the government put a dollar four point five billion pot and said to the governors across the country compete for it
forty eight governors competed convincing forty eight state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum
forty eight states opted in creating a national education policy from the bottom up so i thought well why can 't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs
race to the top because after all if you look at the context
one point six trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally
and every dollar represents a job and where are those jobs going well they 're going to places that have policy like china in fact i was in china to see what they were doing and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that i was with and i was standing in the back
he says take your time
because they see our passivity as their opportunity so what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country
and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that
the bipartisan group approved in congress for the race to the top for education four point five billion which sounds like a lot but actually it 's less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending it 's a rounding error on the federal side but price to entry into that competition
would be you could just say use the president 's goal he wants congress to adopt a clean energy standard of eighty percent by two thousand and thirty in other words that you 'd have to get eighty percent of your energy from clean sources
by the year two thousand and thirty why not ask all of the states
to do that instead and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer you might take
states like iowa and ohio two very important political states by the way those two governors and they would say we 're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy you might say the solar states the sun belt we 're going to be the states that produce
solar energy for the country and maybe jerry brown says well i 'm going to create an industry cluster in california to be able to produce the solar panels so that we 're not buying them
from china but we 're buying them from the u s in fact
every region of the country could do this you see you 've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation in fact
if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west they could do geothermal or you could look at texas and say we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid
in the middle eastern states which have access to forests and to agricultural waste they might say we 're going to lead the nation in biofuels in the
region has something to offer and if you created a competition
it respects the states and it respects federalism it 's opt in you might even get texas and south carolina who didn 't opt into the education race to the top you might even get them to opt in why because republican and democratic governors love to cut ribbons we want to bring jobs
i 'm just saying and it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy now any of you who are
watching anything about politics lately might say okay great idea but really congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table they can 't agree to anything so you could wait
and go through congress although you should be very impatient or you renegades
we could go around congress
go around congress what if
we created a private sector challenge to the governors what if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at ted
decided that they would create band together just a couple of them and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top and see how the governors
what if you were here
how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in america
and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up
from the bottom up because
if you are impatient like i am
you know that our economic competitors our other nations are in the game and are eating us for lunch and we can
get in the game or not we can be at the table
or we can be on the table
