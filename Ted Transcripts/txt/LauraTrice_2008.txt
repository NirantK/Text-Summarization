praise admiration and thank you and having it be specific and genuine and the way i got interested in this was i noticed in myself when i was growing up and until about a few years ago that
i would want to say thank you to someone i would want to praise them i would want to take in their praise of me and i'd just stop it
and i asked myself why i felt shy i felt embarrassed
and then my question became am i the only one who does this so i decided to investigate
their core wound is their father died without ever saying he 's
but then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him but he never told the son it's because he didn't know
needed to hear it so my question is why don't we ask for the things that we need i know a gentleman married for twenty five years who 's longing to hear his wife say thank you for being the bread winner so i can stay home with the kids
for that and a friend of mine april who i've had since kindergarten she thanks her children for doing their chores and she said why wouldn't i thank it even though they're supposed to do it
so the question is why was i blocking it why were other people blocking it why can i say i 'll take my steak medium rare i need size six shoes but i won 't say would you praise me this
and it's because i'm giving you critical data about me i'm telling you where i'm insecure i'm telling you where i need your help
and i'm treating you my inner circle like you're the enemy because what can you do with that data you could neglect me
you could abuse it or you could actually meet my need and i took my bike into the bike store i love this same bike and they'd do something called truing the wheels the guy said you know when you true the wheels it's going to make the bike so much better i get the same bike back
and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i've had for two and a half years and my bike is like new so i'm going to challenge all of you
i want you to true your wheels be honest about the praise that you need to hear what do you need to hear go home to your wife go ask her what does she need go home to your husband what does he
go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you and it's simple and why should we care about this we talk about world peace how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages
i think it starts household by household under the same roof so let 's make it right in our own backyard and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands great mothers friends daughters sons
and maybe somebody 's never said that to you but you've done a really really good job and thank you for being here about the importance of
