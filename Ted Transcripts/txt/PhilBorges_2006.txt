fact came out of mit
so that in one generation we're going to halve our cultural diversity he went on to say that every two weeks
an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture so an entire philosophy
a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries goes away
and this happens every two weeks so for the last twenty years since my
have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people
and what i'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you this is tamdin she is a sixty nine year old nun
she was thrown in prison in tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country
and when i met her she had just taken a walk over the himalayas from lhasa the capital of tibet
into nepal across to india
thirty days to meet her leader the dalai lama the dalai lama lives in dharamsala india so i took this picture three days after she arrived
and he was his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the dalai lama had to leave and
he was beaten starved tortured lost all his teeth while in prison and when i met him he was a kind gentle old man
and it really impressed me i met him two weeks after he got out of prison that he went through that experience and ended up with the demeanor that he had
so i was in dharamsala meeting these people and i'd spent about five weeks there and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet
into dharamsala and it just so happened on the fifth week there was a public teaching by the dalai lama and
and i was watching this crowd of monks and nuns many of which i had just interviewed and heard their stories and i watched their faces and they gave us a little fm radio and we could listen to the translation of his teachings
and what he said was
treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels
because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment and i
that hit me so hard
and i started interviewing the people there taking my photographs that's what i do i interview and do portraits and and this is a little girl i took her portrait up on top of the jokhang temple
and i'd snuck in because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet it's the quickest way you can get arrested
so i snuck in a bunch of little wallet sized pictures of the dalai lama and i would hand them out and when i gave them to the people
i was going in interviewing these people and doing their portraits this is jigme and her sister sonam and they live up on the chang tang the tibetan plateau way in the western part of the country this is at seventeen thousand feet
and they had just come down from the high pastures at eighteen thousand feet same thing gave her a picture she held it up to her forehead
and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these because i'm setting up lights and checking my lights and when i showed her a polaroid she screamed and ran into her tent
way out in the middle of nowhere at the age of four he was installed as the fourteenth dalai lama
as a teenager he faced
the invasion of his country and had to deal with it he was the leader of the country eight years later when they discovered there was a plot to kill him
they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on a horseback and took the same trip that tamdin did and he lives in and he 's never been back to his country since and
if you think about this man forty six years later still sticking to this non violent response
to a severe political and human rights issue and the young people young tibetans are starting to say listen this doesn't work you know
he still is holding this line so this is our icon
to non violence in our world one of our living icons
this is another leader of his people this is moi this is in the ecuadorian amazon and moi is thirty five years old and
as much oil or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident
was spilled in this little area of the amazon and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move and
belongs to the huaorani tribe and they're known as very fierce they're known as auca and they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil oil workers with spears and blowguns
and i spent we spent i was with a team two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt this was on a monkey hunt
and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible they could hear things smell things see things i couldn't see and i couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts
this is yadira and yadira is five years old she's in a a tribe that's neighboring the
and her tribe has had to move three times in the last ten years because of the oil spills and we never hear about that and the latest
thousands of acres of the ecuadorian amazon in our war on drugs
and these people are the people who take the brunt of it
this is mengatoue he 's the shaman of the huaorani and he
he just he said to us you know i'm an older man now i'm getting tired you know i'm tired of spearing these oil workers i wish they would just go away
and i was i usually travel alone when i do my work but i did this i hosted a program for discovery and when i went down with the team i was one of the things
just before nine eleven august of two thousand and one
i took my son dax who was sixteen at the time and i took him to pakistan because at first i wanted you know i've taken him on a couple of trips
but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less i wanted him to get an experience in the islamic world
and i also wanted him to i was going there to work with a group do a story on a group called the kalash that are a group of animists three thousand animists that live very small area surrounded by islam there's three thousand
of these kalash left they're incredible people so it was a great experience for him he stayed up all night with them drumming and dancing
and he brought a soccer ball and we had soccer every night in this little village and then we went up and met their
by the way mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well and this is john doolikahn who 's
and he 's up in the mountains right on the border with afghanistan in fact on that other side is the area tora bora the area where osama bin laden 's supposed to be this is the tribal area and
we watched and stayed with john doolikahn and
the shaman i did a whole series on shamanism which is a an interesting phenomenon but around the world
they go into trance in different ways and in pakistan the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke
and they're all praying to the mountain gods as they as they go into trance that was
you know getting kids used to different realities i think is so important what dan dennett said the other day
having a curriculum where they study different religions just to make a mental flexibility give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems i think this is so
five years ago we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the united states so we first hooked up
spot in the navajo nation with a classroom in seattle we now have fifteen sites
one in kathmandu nepal dharamsala india takaungu kenya takaungu is one third christian one third muslim and one third animist the community
peru and arctic village alaska this is daniel he 's one of our students in arctic village alaska he lives in this log cabin
no running water no heat other than no windows and high speed internet connection and this is
this is i see this rolling out all over this is our site in ollantaytambo peru four years ago where they first saw their first computers now they have computers in their classrooms
and the way we do it is we do it in workshops and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling and have them
work with the kids and just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in and this has worked the best so our dream is to bring teenagers together so they'll have a community service experience
as well as a cross cultural experience as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure this is teaching photoshop in the children 's tibetan children 's village in dharamsala
we have the website where the kids all get their homepage this is all their movies we've got about sixty movies that these kids have made and they're quite incredible the one i want to show you after
get them to make the movies we have a night where we show the movies to the community and this is in takaungu we've got a generator and a digital projector and we're projecting it up against a barn
and showing one of the movies that they made and if you get a chance you can go to our website and you'll see the incredible work these kids do
the kids in our the other thing i wanted to give indigenous people a voice that was one of the big motivating factors
but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country national geographic just did a roper study of eighteen to twenty six year olds in
our country and in nine other industrialized countries it was a two million dollar study united states came in second to last
in geographic knowledge seventy percent of the kids couldn't find afghanistan or iraq on a map
sixty percent couldn't find india
thirty percent couldn't find the pacific ocean and this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago
so what i'd like to show you now in the couple of minutes i have left
is a film that a student made in guatemala we just had a workshop in guatemala
a week before we got to the workshop
a massive landslide caused by hurricane stan last october came in and buried six hundred people alive in their village and this kid lived in the village he wasn't there at the time
and this is the little movie he put together about that and he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie we taught him photoshop and yeah we can play is an old mayan
