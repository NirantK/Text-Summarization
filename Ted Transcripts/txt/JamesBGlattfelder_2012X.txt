there is also a strong belief and overconfident economics
the first quote is from jean claude trichet when he was governor of the european central bank
the second quote is from the head of the u k financial services authority are these people implying that we don 't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies it gets worse we spend billions of dollars
trying to understand the origins of the universe
while we still don 't understand the conditions
the conditions for a stable society
a functioning economy or peace what 's happening here
how can this be possible do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions unfortunately the answer is yes
but there 's an intriguing solution which is coming from
what is known as the science of complexity to explain what this means and what this thing is please let me quickly take a couple of steps back
i ended up in physics by accident it was a random encounter when i was young and since then i 've often wondered about the amazing success of physics
in describing the reality we wake up in every day in a nutshell you can think of physics as follows so you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics
you encode it into equations then predictions can be made and tested
despite the success physics has its limits as dirk helbing pointed out in the last quote we don 't really understand the complexity that relates to us that surrounds us
this paradox is what got me interested in complex systems so these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts swarms of birds or fish
these are just a few examples
interestingly complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations so
the usual physics approach doesn 't really work here so what do we know about complex systems well
it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction
this means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system
by looking at the interactions so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions and it gets even better because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood
or predicted by looking at the components of the system so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts
and all of this also means that you can forget about the individual
or a bird you just focus on the rules of interaction
as a result networks are ideal representations of complex systems
the nodes in the network are the system 's components and the links are given by the interactions so what equations are for physics
complex networks are for the study of complex systems
this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics biology computer science the social sciences but what about economics
where are economic networks this is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature
the study we published last year called
the network of global corporate control
was the first extensive analysis of economic networks the study went viral on the internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media
this is quite remarkable because again why did no one look at this before similar data has been around for quite some time what we looked at in detail was ownership networks so
here the nodes are companies people governments foundations etc
and the links represent the shareholding relations so shareholder a has x percent of the shares in company b and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue
so ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations
now you may think that no one 's looked at this before because ownership networks are really really boring to study well as ownership is related to control as i shall explain later looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like
who are the key players how are they organized are they isolated are they interconnected and what is the overall distribution of control
a high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic
scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data
because a foundational guideline in science is let the data speak okay let 's do that so we started with a database containing thirteen million ownership relations from two thousand and seven this is a lot of data and because we wanted to find out who rules the world
we decided to focus on transnational corporations
or tncs for short these are companies that operate in more than one country and we found forty three thousand
in the next step we built the network around these companies so we took all the tncs shareholders and the shareholders shareholders etc all the way upstream and we did the same downstream and ended up with a network containing six hundred thousand nodes and one million links this is the tnc network which we analyzed
and it turns out to be structured as follows so you have a periphery and a center which contains about seventy five percent of all the players and in the center there 's this tiny but dominant core
which is made up of highly interconnected companies to give you a better picture think about a metropolitan area so you have the suburbs and the periphery you have a center like
a financial district then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center
and we already see signs of organization going on here
thirty six percent of the tncs
are in the core only but they make up ninety five percent of the total operating revenue of all tncs
okay so now we analyzed the structure so how does this relate to the control well
ownership gives voting rights to shareholders this is the normal notion of control
and there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership
if you have more than fifty percent of the shares in a company you get control
but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares and the network really matters
about ten years ago mr tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company
which had ownership and control in a bigger company you get the idea this ended up giving him control in telecom italia with a leverage of twenty six
now what we actually computed
in our study was the control over the tncs value this allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder
this is very much in the sense of max weber 's idea of potential power
which is the probability of imposing one 's own will despite the opposition of others
if you want to compute the flow
in an ownership network this is what you have to do it 's actually not that hard to understand let me explain by giving you this analogy so think about water flowing in pipes where the pipes have different thickness so similarly the control is flowing in the ownership networks
and is accumulating at the nodes
so what did we find after computing all this network control well it turns out that the seven hundred and thirty seven top shareholders have the potential to collectively control eighty percent of the tncs value
now remember we started out with six hundred thousand nodes so
these seven hundred and thirty seven top players make up a bit more than zero point one percent
they 're mostly financial institutions in the u s and the u k and it gets even more extreme there are one hundred and forty six top players in the core
and they together have the potential to collectively control forty percent of the tncs value
what should you take home from all of this
the high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core
could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy
and we could easily reproduce the tnc network with a few simple rules
this means that its structure is probably the result of self organization it 's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system so it 's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy
our study is an impression of the moon 's surface it 's not a street map so you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt yet
it gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future
and this is slowly starting we 're seeing the emergence of long term and highly funded programs
which aim at understanding our networked world
from a complexity point of view but this journey has only just begun so we will have to wait before we see the first results
now there is still a big problem in my opinion
ideas relating to finance economics politics society
i really hope that this complexity perspective
allows for some common ground to be found it would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas
which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world
we need to move away from dogma but this is just my own personal ideology thank you immediately became apparent
