namaskar good morning given my ted profile you might be expecting that i'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends
the one that's currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing how to invest in women how to empower them how to
not me i am interested in how women are saving us they're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and
in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing
in most societies is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance
when so many women and girls are beaten raped maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes honor religion nationality
doing the preserving and the radicalizing or are
and the same are we guilty as chimamanda adichie reminded us at a ted conference in oxford of assuming that there is a single story
of women 's struggles for their rights while there are in fact many and what if anything do men have to do with it
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions it's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people
in the process i've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle among those who 've helped open my eyes to a third way
a devout muslim in afghanistan a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia
and a taboo breaker in liberia i'm indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life
i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down
us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters
you're young you could still try again my sense of outrage
about women 's rights was brought to a boil when i was about eleven my aunt an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman was widowed early
a flock of relatives descended on her they took off her colorful sari they made her wear a white one
off her forehead they broke her bangles her daughter rani a few years older than me
sat in her lap bewildered not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother
night i heard my mother begging my father please do something ramu can't you intervene and my father
in a low voice muttering i 'm just the youngest brother there's nothing i can do this is tradition
that's the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world women don't make those rules but they define us and they define our opportunities and our chances
and men are effected by those rules too my father who had fought in three wars could not save his own sister from this suffering
by eighteen under the excellent tutelage of my mother i was therefore as you might expect defiantly feminist on the streets the
from beijing i leaped at the chance to work for this wonderful organization founded by women to support women 's rights organizations around the
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states she said to me it is not about the burka she was the most
advocate for women 's rights i had ever heard she told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan and that her organization the afghan institute for learning had started a school in pakistan
she said the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy
the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves had i heard right was a women 's rights advocate invoking religion
but sakena defies labels she always wears a headscarf but i've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the
she starts every lecture with a prayer but she's a single feisty financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of twelve she is also immensely pragmatic
this headscarf and these clothes she says give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp i went to see the imam i told him i 'm a believer and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive
she smiled slyly he was flattered he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind
we began with a small literacy class to read the koran then a math class then an english class then computer classes in a few weeks everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes sakena is a teacher
at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in afghanistan she is on the taliban 's hit list i worry about her every time she travels across that country she shrugs when i ask her about safety
jan we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face and i smile and i nod realizing i'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices
is something the women of lesbor in zagreb croatia know all too well to be a lesbian a dyke a homosexual in most parts of the world including right here in our country india
is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice in post conflict societies like croatia where a hyper nationalism and religiousity have created an environment unbearable
anyone who might be considered a social outcast so enter a group of out dykes young women
who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia from serbia to slovenia these folk singers met at
in families religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick just queer
we blend the two i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion in which people can really speak their voice especially traditional songs from other parts of the former
after the war lots of these songs were lost but they're a part of our childhood and our history and we should not forget them improbably this l g b t singing choir
has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change like alchemists turning discord into harmony their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem
a bosnian love song and serbian duets and leah adds with a grin kavita we are especially proud of our christmas music
because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us l g b t
concerts draw from their own communities yes but also from an older generation a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality
but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents one father who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir now writes songs for them
in the middle ages troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this
singing connecting people divided by religion nationality and language bosnians croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride
in their history and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all
showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given the world layma bowie was given was a world
she worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier she worried her daughters would be raped she worried for their lives one night she had a dream she dreamed she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed
the next morning at church she asked others how they felt they were all tired of the fighting we need peace and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace
among layma 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim she promised to raise the issue with her community
at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs what does it matter they said a bullet doesn't distinguish between a muslim and a christian
this small group of women determined to bring an end to the war and they chose to use their traditions to make a point liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing
but no for the protest they dressed all in white no makeup as layma said we wore the white saying we were out for peace they stood on the side of the road
which charles taylor 's motorcade passed every day they stood for weeks first just ten then twenty then fifty then hundreds of women
wearing white singing dancing saying they were out for peace eventually opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana
the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building in a now famous cnn clip you can see them sitting on the ground their arms linked we know this in india it's
then things get tense the police are called in to physically remove the women as the senior officer approaches with
you can see the policeman 's face he looks embarrassed he backs away and the next thing you know the police have disappeared layma said to me later
you know in west africa if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to the man 's family
i don't know if he did it because he believed but he knew we were not going to leave we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed and the peace accord was signed
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in
when she made her presidential address she acknowledged these brave women of liberia who allowed her to win against a football star that's soccer for you americans
no less women like sakena and leah and layma
have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind
with heat from the bottom and heat from the top the protests the marches the uncompromising position that women 's rights are human rights full stop
that's the heat from the bottom that's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades but we also need the heat from the top
and in most parts of the world that top is still controlled by men so to paraphrase marx women make change but not in circumstances of their own choosing
they have to negotiate they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations and they need allies from their communities allies like the
allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and
like my father who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams
maybe this is because feminism unlike almost every other social movement is not against a distinct oppressor it's not the ruling class or the
the colonizers it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often
it starts in small places close to home on the streets yes but also
in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and
and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles women like
and leah and layma but also sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in
doing something else they're challenging the very notion of western models of development they are saying we don't have to be like you
to make change we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers
we can use our tradition to navigate change we can demilitarize societies and pour resources instead into reservoirs of genuine security
it is in these little stories these individual stories that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world
it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities that i find hope
a whole of a whole new world and she is definitely on her way thank you
