when my hand slips i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft
as i stand talking to you today these men are still deep in that hole risking their lives without payment or compensation
and often dying i got to climb out of that hole
and i got to go home
but they likely never will because they 're trapped in slavery for the last twenty eight years i 've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than seventy countries on six continents and in two thousand and nine i had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the vancouver peace
amongst all the astonishing people i met there
i met a supporter of free the slaves an ngo dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery
we started talking about slavery and really i started learning about slavery for i had certainly known it existed in the world but not to such a degree
after we finished talking i felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime and i thought if i don 't know
how many other people don 't know it started burning a hole in my stomach so within weeks i flew down to los angeles to meet with the director of free the slaves and offer them my help
thus began my journey into modern day slavery oddly i had been to many of these places before
some i even considered like my second home
but this time i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet a conservative estimate tells us there are more than twenty seven
million people enslaved in the world today that 's double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire trans atlantic slave trade a hundred and fifty years ago an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker
each year many have been tricked by false promises of a good education a better job
people producing them are disposable slavery exists everywhere nearly in the world and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world
and nepal i was introduced to the brick kilns this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or dante 's inferno enveloped in temperatures of one hundred and thirty degrees men women children
entire families in fact were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust while mechanically stacking bricks on their head up to eighteen at a time and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away
deadened by monotony and exhaustion they work silently doing this task over and over for sixteen or seventeen hours a day there were no breaks for food
no water breaks and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential
so pervasive was the heat and the dust
that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working
every twenty minutes i 'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it and as i sat there
i thought my camera is getting far better treatment than these people back in the kilns i wanted to cry
but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said lisa
don 't do that just don 't do that here and he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this not just for me
i couldn 't offer them any direct help i couldn 't give them money nothing
i wasn 't a citizen of that country i could get them in a worse situation than they were already in i 'd have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation and i trusted
in the himalayas i found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below
the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth
because this has been the case all their lives they have nothing
to compare it to when these villagers claimed their freedom the slaveholders burned down all
but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own so that now they do the same back breaking work but they do it for themselves
and they get paid for it and they do it in freedom
sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery and because of this worldwide awareness i was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry
in kathmandu i was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty dimly fluorescent lit basement
this wasn 't a brothel per se it was more like a restaurant cabin restaurants as they 're known in the trade are venues for forced prostitution
each has small private rooms where the slaves women along with young girls and boys some as young as seven years old are forced to entertain the clients encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol
each cubicle is dark and dingy
identified with a painted number on the wall and partitioned by plywood and a curtain
standing in the near darkness i remember feeling this quick hot fear and in that instant i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped
have no escape at all
and as we take in such a difficult subject it 's important to note that slavery including sex trafficking occurs in our own backyard as well
tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture in restaurants in domestic servitude and the list can go on
recently the new york times reported that between one hundred thousand and three hundred thousand american children are sold into sex slavery every year it 's all around us we just don 't see
the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor
i visited villages in india where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade this is a family portrait the dyed black hands
my interpreter told me their stories we have
no freedom they said we hope still though that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing
it 's estimated that more than four thousand children are enslaved on lake volta the largest man made lake in the world
when we first arrived i went to have a quick look i saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat two older brothers some younger kids makes sense right
wrong they were all enslaved children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished
and they 're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake even though they do not know how to swim
this young child is eight years old he was trembling when our boat approached frightened it would run over his tiny canoe he was petrified he would be knocked in the water
the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta
often catch the fishing nets and weary frightened children are thrown into the water
for as long as he can recall he 's been forced to work on the lake terrified of his master he will not run away and since he 's been treated with cruelty all his life he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages
i met these boys at five in the morning when they were hauling in the last of their nets but they had been working since one a m in the cold windy night and it 's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand
kofi was rescued from a fishing village i met him at a shelter where free the slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery
here he 's seen taking a bath at the well pouring big buckets of water over his head
kofi is the embodiment of possibility who will he become
because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window
he told us to follow him
as we started down the path
we pushed aside the vines blocking the way and after about an hour of walking in found that the trail had become flooded
by recent rains so i hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest after another two hours of hiking the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing
and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field and all of them
were full of enslaved people laboring many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold wading in water poisoned
by mercury mercury is used in the extraction process
these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana
when they came out of the shaft they were soaking wet from their own sweat i remember looking into their tired bloodshot eyes for many of them had been underground for seventy two
at first glance the pounding site seems full of
we see some less fortunate working on the fringes and children too
all of them are victim to injury illness and violence
in fact it 's very likely that this muscular person when his father died
when his father died which further forced him
into being enslaved in the mines when i met him he had been working in the mines for fourteen years
and the leg injury that you see here he has a dream
that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves
i want to shine a light on slavery
when i was working in the field i brought lots of candles with me and with the help of my interpreter
i imparted to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories
and their plight so when it was safe for them
and that we will do whatever we can
to help make a difference in their lives i truly believe if we can see one another as fellow human beings then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery
these images are not of issues they are of people
real people like you and me all deserving of the same rights dignity and respect in their lives there is not a day that goes by that i don 't think of these many beautiful the beast of bondage
can continue to live in the shadows thank you very much i can
