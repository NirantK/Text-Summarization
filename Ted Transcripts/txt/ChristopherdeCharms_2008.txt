raise your arms and wave back just the way i am kind of a royal wave you can mimic what you can see you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm soon you'll be able to look inside your brain
and program control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there i'm going to tell you about that technology people have wanted to look inside the human mind the human brain
for thousands of years well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that
but now we have a real technology to do this we're going to fly into my colleague peter 's brain we're going to do it non invasively using mri we don't have to inject anything we don't need radiation
will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter 's brain literally fly into his body but more importantly we can look into his mind when peter moves his arm
that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter 's mind taking place now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains what's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis we've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds
and that allows peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner he can look at these sixty five thousand points of activation per second if he can see this pattern in his own brain
he can learn how to control it there have been three ways to try to impact the brain the therapist 's couch pills and the knife
this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have
we all know that as we form thoughts they form deep channels in our minds and our brains chronic pain is an example if you burn yourself you pull your hand away
but if you're still in pain in six months or six years time it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you
if we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain we can form three d models and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the areas that produce the pain so put your arms back up and flex your
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing what you're seeing here is we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain
may shock you but we're literally reading this person 's brain in real time they're watching their own brain activation and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain
they're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates as they do it in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled when they control their brain they can control their pain
this is an investigational technology but in clinical trials we're seeing a forty four to sixty four percent decrease in chronic pain patients this is not the matrix you can only do this to yourself you take control
i've seen inside my brain you will too soon when you do what do you want to control
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself all your experiences these are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail
but i want to leave with you the big question we are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into using this technology the human mind and brain
where will we take it
