talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do
this is the second project that i did it's a fax machine i put an attractive shell around some new technology
again eighteen months later the product was obsolete and now of course the whole technology is obsolete
now i'm a fairly slow learner but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important
by focusing on a design maybe just a single product i was being incremental and not having much of an impact
but i think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomena and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century as design became a tool of consumerism
so when we talk about design today and particularly when we read about it in the popular press we're often talking about products like these amusing yes desirable maybe important not so very
on the object and more on design thinking as an approach that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact
now this gentleman isambard kingdom brunel designed many great things in his career in the nineteenth century including the
his greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford it's called the great western railway and as a kid i grew up very close to here and
one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past you can see it represented here in j m w turner 's painting rain steam and speed
this was back in the nineteenth century and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made which meant building
long viaducts across river valleys this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead and long tunnels such as the one at box
but he didn't stop there he didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey he imagined an integrated transportation system
in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark
from a ship in new york one journey from london to new york
this is the s s great western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey now brunel was working one hundred years before the emergence of the design profession
but i think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world changing innovations
opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions in the case of design that means balancing desirability
what humans need with technical feasibility and economic viability
with innovations like the great western we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit
so somehow we went from this to this
as our industrial society matured so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics image and fashion
now i'm not trying to throw stones here i'm a fully paid up member of that priesthood and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses
but i do think that perhaps design is getting big again and that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems to global warming to education
and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems there are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful and i'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes
the first of those is that design is human centered it may integrate technology and economics
but it starts with what humans need or might need what makes life easier more enjoyable what makes technology useful and usable
they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening
we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids in places like india those technicians simply don't exist
so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a
might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service instead of starting with technology the team started with people and culture
so if human need is the place to start then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making instead of thinking about what to build building in order to think
now prototypes speed up the process of innovation because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses and the faster we do that the faster our ideas evolve
now much has been said and written about the aravind eye institute in madurai india they do an incredible job of serving very poor patients
by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross subsidize those who can not now they are very efficient but they are also very innovative
when i visited them a few years ago what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early
this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs they make their own intraocular lenses these are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts
and i think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough because they brought the cost down from two hundred dollars a pair down to just four dollars a pair
partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory they used the basement of one of their hospitals and instead of installing the large scale machines
used by western producers they used low cost cad cam prototyping technology they are now the biggest manufacture of lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory
so if human need is the place to start and prototyping a vehicle for progress then there are also some questions to ask about the destination instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption
design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation the shift from a passive relationship between
many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured is going to be the major theme not only for design but also for our economy as we go forward
in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well being
by the time he wrote his third report he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers
they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state so in one of their projects called southwark circle they worked with residents in southwark south london and a small team of designers to develop
a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks designs were refined and developed with one hundred and fifty older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year
we can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone
nurses and practitioners at u s healthcare system kaiser permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience and
they went from retreating to the nurse 's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients using a simple software tool
by doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from forty minutes to twelve minutes on average they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness
so these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to
but i'd like to go back to brunel here and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now and maybe why design
is a useful tool and that connection is change in times of change we need new alternatives new ideas
now brunel worked at the height of the industrial revolution when all of life and our economy was being reinvented now
the industrial systems of brunel 's time have run their course and indeed they are part of the problem today but again we are in the midst of massive change
and that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society how we keep ourselves healthy how we govern ourselves
how we educate ourselves how we keep ourselves secure and in these times of change we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete
so why design thinking because it gives us a new way of tackling problems instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives
it encourages us to take a divergent approach to explore new alternatives new solutions new ideas that have not existed before
but before we go through that process of divergence there is actually quite an important first step and that is what is the question that we're trying to answer what's the design brief now brunel may have asked a question like this how do i take a train from london to new york
but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today
so these are some that we've been asked to think about recently
and one in particular is one that we're working on with the acumen fund in a project that's been funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation how might we improve
access to safe drinking water for the world 's poorest people and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers
so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate we took a sort of more open collaborative and participative approach
we teamed designers and investment experts up with eleven water organizations across india and through workshops they developed innovative new products services and business models
we hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas so they developed and iterated these ideas and then ideo and acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new
social marketing campaigns community outreach strategies business models new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water
those ideas are just getting launched into the market and the same process is just getting underway with ngos in east africa so for me
this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career
by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly by
so that's one thing that we've been working on i'm actually really quite interested and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks
we could work on what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle and
if you've got any ideas then feel free you can post them to twitter there is a hash tag there that you can use cbdq and so i'd like to
believe that design thinking actually can make a difference that it can help create new ideas and new innovations beyond the latest high street products
to do that i think we have to take a more expansive view of design more like brunel less a domain of a professional priesthood
