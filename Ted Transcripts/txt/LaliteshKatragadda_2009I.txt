two thousand and eight cyclone nargis devastated myanmar millions of people were in severe need of help
the u n wanted to rush people and supplies to the area but there were no maps no maps of roads no maps showing hospitals no way for help to reach the cyclone victims
the u n ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world 's populous faces not having detailed maps
but help was coming at google forty volunteers used a new software to map one hundred and twenty thousand kilometers of roads three thousand hospitals logistics and relief points and it took them four days the new software they used google mapmaker
google mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally people have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers
from schools to local businesses and video stores to the corner store maps matter nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land
for example a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone
in the last year alone thousands of users in one hundred and seventy countries have mapped millions of pieces of information and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable and this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere
let 's look at some of the maps being created by users right now so as we speak people are mapping the world in these one hundred and seventy countries you can see bridget in africa who just mapped a road in senegal
and closer to home chalua an n g road in bangalore
this is the result of computational geometry gesture recognition and machine learning this is a victory of thousands of users in hundreds of cities one user one edit at a time this is an invitation to the seventy percent of our unmapped planet
