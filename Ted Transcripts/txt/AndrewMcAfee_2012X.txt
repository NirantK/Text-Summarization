turns out when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed there 's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force and as i look at the conversation it strikes me that it 's focused on exactly the right topic
and at the same time it 's missing the point entirely the topic that it 's focused on the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people 's ability to earn a living or to say it a little bit different way are the droids taking our jobs and there 's some evidence that they are
the great recession ended when american gdp resumed its kind of slow steady march upward
and some other economic indicators also started to rebound and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly corporate profits are quite high in fact if you include bank profits they 're higher than they 've ever been
and business investment in gear in equipment and hardware and software is at an all time high so the businesses are getting out their checkbooks what they 're not really doing is hiring
so this red line is the employment to population ratio in other words the percentage of working age people in america who have work
and we see that it cratered during the great recession and it hasn 't started to bounce back at all but the story is not just a recession story the decade that we 've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout especially when we compare it to other decades
and the two thousand s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning
this is not what you want to see when you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time
and then during the great recession it opened up in a huge way
i did some quick calculations i took the last twenty years of gdp growth and the last twenty years of labor productivity growth
and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing and this is the line that i came up with is that good or bad this is the government 's projection for the working age population going forward
so if these predictions are accurate that gap is not going to close the problem is i don 't think these projections are accurate in particular i think my projection is way too optimistic because when i did it
i was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past with labor productivity growth and that 's actually not what i believe because when i look around
i think that we ain 't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology 's impact on the labor force
just in the past couple years we 've seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never ever had before
and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living let me give you a couple examples throughout all of history if you wanted something translated from one language into another you had to involve a human being
now we have multi language instantaneous automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices all the way down to smartphones and if any of us have used these we know that they 're not perfect but they 're decent
throughout all of history if you wanted something written a report or an article you had to involve a person not anymore this is an article that appeared in forbes online a while back about apple 's earnings it was written by an algorithm and it 's not decent it 's perfect
a lot of people look at this and they say okay but those are very specific narrow tasks and most knowledge workers are actually generalists and what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands and that 's very very hard to automate
one of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory
took home three million dollars
that 's ken on the right getting beat three to one by watson the jeopardy playing supercomputer from ibm so when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers
i start to think there might not be something so special about this idea of a generalist particularly when we start doing things like hooking siri up to watson
and having technologies that can understand what we 're saying and repeat speech back to us now siri is far from perfect and we can make fun of her flaws but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like siri and watson improve along a moore 's law trajectory
which they will in six years they 're not going to be two times better or four times better they 'll be sixteen times better than they are right now so i start to think that a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this
and digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work they 're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well i had the chance a little while back to ride in the google autonomous car which is as cool as it sounds
but they 're getting better quite quickly and darpa which is the investment arm of the defense department is trying to accelerate their trajectory so in short yeah the droids are coming for our jobs in the short term we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship
and by investing in infrastructure because the robots today still aren 't very good at fixing bridges but in the not too long term i think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room
we 're going to transition into an economy that is very productive but that just doesn 't need a lot of human workers and managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces voltaire summarized why he said work saves us from three great evils boredom vice and need
but despite this challenge i 'm personally i 'm still a huge digital optimist and i am supremely confident
that the digital technologies that we 're developing now are going to take us into a utopian future not a dystopian future and to explain why i want to pose kind of a ridiculously broad question i want to ask what have been the most important developments in human history
now i want to share some of the answers that i 've gotten in response to this question it 's a wonderful question to ask and to start an endless debate about because some people are going to bring up systems of philosophy in both the west and the east that have changed how a lot of people think about the world
and then other people will say no actually the big stories the big developments are the founding of the world 's major religions which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced how countless people are living their lives
there are some optimistic answers to this question so some people will bring up the age of exploration and the opening up of the world others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world and other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences
no single answer to it but if you 're a geek like me you say well what do the data say
and you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in the total worldwide population for example or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society and you start to plot the data because by this approach
the big stories the big developments in human history are the ones that will bend these curves a lot
so when you do this and when you plot the data you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions you conclude actually that none of these things have mattered very much
one story one development in human history that bent the curve bent it just about ninety degrees and it is a technology story
the steam engine and the other associated technologies of the industrial revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much that in the words of the historian ian morris they made mockery out of all that had come before
and they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles overcoming the limitations of our muscles now what we 're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying our mental power how can this not be as big a deal
as overcoming the limitations of our muscles so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit when i look at what 's going on with digital technology these days we are not anywhere near through with this journey
and when i look at what is happening to our economies and our societies my single conclusion is that we ain 't seen nothing yet the best days are really ahead let me give you a couple examples economies don 't run on energy
they don 't run on capital they don 't run on labor economies run on ideas so the work of innovation the work of coming up with new ideas is some of the most powerful some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy and this is kind of how we used to do innovation we 'd find a bunch of fairly similar looking people
as a white guy who spent his whole career at mit and harvard i got no problem with this
where they went to school or what they look like all anyone cares about is the quality of the work the quality of the ideas and over and over again we see this happening in the technology facilitated world
the work of innovation is becoming more open more inclusive more transparent and more merit based and that 's going to continue no matter what mit and harvard think of it and i couldn 't be happier about that development
i hear once in a while okay i 'll grant you that but technology is still a tool for the rich world and what 's not happening these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid and i want to say to that very clearly
nonsense the bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology the economist robert jensen did this wonderful study a while back where he watched in great detail what happened to the fishing villages of kerala india when they got mobile phones for the very first time
and when you write for the quarterly journal of economics you have to use very dry and very circumspect language but when i read his paper i kind of feel jensen is trying to scream at us and say look this was a big deal
prices stabilized so people could plan their economic lives waste was not reduced it was eliminated
and the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved now what i don 't think
is that jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better
what happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community the lives of people the welfares of people improve dramatically
so as i look around at all the evidence and i think about the room that we have ahead of us i become a huge digital optimist and i start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist freeman dyson is actually not hyperbole
this is an accurate assessment of what 's going on our digital our technologies are great gifts and we right now have the great good fortune
to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world
so yeah the droids are taking our jobs but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely the point is that then we are freed up to do other things
and what we are going to do i am very confident what we 're going to do is reduce poverty and drudgery and misery around the world i 'm very confident we 're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet
and i am extremely confident that what we 're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound
