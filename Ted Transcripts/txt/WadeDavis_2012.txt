it 's a valley where in a long day perhaps too you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf
and drink from the very sources of water
gave rise and cradled the great civilizations of the northwest coast
it 's such a beautiful place it 's the most stunningly wild place i 've ever been it 's the sort of place that we as canadians could throw england
and they 'd never find it john muir in one thousand eight hundred and seventy nine went up just the lower third of the stikine and he was so enraptured he called it a yosemite one hundred and fifty miles long he came back to california and named his dog after that river of enchantment
in the lower forty eight the farthest you can get away from a maintained road is twenty miles
in the northwest quadrant of british columbia an area of land the size of oregon there 's one road a narrow ribbon of asphalt that slips up the side of the coast mountains to the yukon
i followed that road in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s soon after it was built to take a job as the first park ranger in spatsizi wilderness
my job description was deliciously vague wilderness assessment and public relations man
and over the course of thirty years i recorded traditional tales from alex mostly mythological accounts of wy ghet the trickster transformer of gitxsan lore who in his folly taught the people how to live on the land
it was only when alex passed away that i realized that the eyelids in some sense were my own and having done so much to allow me to learn to see alex in his own way was saying goodbye
well isolation has been the great saving grace of this remarkable place but today isolation could be its doom
you 've heard so much about the developments of the tar sands the controversy about the keystone and the enbridge pipelines but these are just elements of a tsunami of industrial development that is sweeping across all of the wild country of northern canada
in tahltan territory alone there are forty one major industrial proposals some with great promise some of great concern on todagin mountain
revered by the tahltan people as a wildlife sanctuary in the sky home to the largest population of stone sheep
on the planet imperial metals but the seventy fifth biggest mining company in all of canada has secured permits to establish an open pit copper and gold mine which will process thirty thousand tons of rock a day for thirty years
generating hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste that by the project 's design will simply be dumped into the lakes of the sacred headwaters at the headwaters itself
shell canada has plans to extract methane gas
from coal seams that underly a million acres
fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals establishing perhaps as many as six thousand wellheads and eventually a network of roads and pipelines and flaring wellheads all to generate methane gas that most likely will go east to fuel the expansion of the tar sands
for over a decade the tahltan people both clans wolf and crow have resisted this assault on their homeland men women and children of all ages
elders in wheelchairs have blockaded the only road access to the interior for them the headwaters is a kitchen it 's a sanctuary it 's a burial ground of their ancestors and those who really own it are the generations as yet unborn
the tahltan have been able with the support of all canadians who live downstream all local politicians to resist this assault on their homeland but now everything hangs in the balance
decisions that will be made this year will literally determine the fate of this country the tahltan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in british columbia
our goal is not only to help them do that but to encourage our friends the good people at shell not only to withdraw from the sacred headwaters but to move forward with us and join us as we do the remarkable the extraordinary
set aside a protected area that will be for all time not simply the sacred headwaters of the tahltan people but the sacred headwaters of all people in the world the tahltan need your help
we need your help and if any of you would like to join us on this great adventure please come and see me later today thank you very much
