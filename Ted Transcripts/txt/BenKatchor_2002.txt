i'm going to read a few strips these are most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine
called metropolis and the first story is called the faulty switch another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch
it's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight but at dusk everything changes the
hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates
for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these seventy nine cent switches behind them we know
where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed
in the simulated glow of late afternoon light recalls to mind a dirty men 's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop
this sound colors our first impression of any room it can't be helped but where does this sound commonly described as a click
come from is is simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action
or is it an imitation of one half a set of sounds we make to express disappointment the often dedental consonant of no indo european language
or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach
in the nineteen fifties they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches
and silent knob controls but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic
the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every lightless room
the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature
it has a deep melancholy ring children don't like it it's why they leave lights on around the house
adults find it comforting but wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship or the recorded crowing of a rooster
the distant peel of thunder thomas
edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric lightbulb
why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch that's the end
praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration
these one or two story structures designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings
yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction
although they make no claim to architectural beauty they are in their perfect temporariness
a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place
the most perfect examples occupy corner lots
they offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them a break of light and air an architectural biding of time
so buried in signage are these structures that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor
the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer
the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive dark green gray striated aluminum siding
take out sandwich shops film processing drop offs peep shows and necktie stores
now these provisional structures have in some cases remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime
the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy sublimation of the urge to build
and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone that's the end
the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead thirty cubits from foot to knee
it was not until the fourteenth century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple upholstered in flesh and cloth
over the next two hundred years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin 's lap and then back again
every child recapitulates this ascension straddling one or both legs sitting sideways or leaning against the body
from there to the modern ventriloquist 's dummy is but a brief moment in history you were late for school again this morning
the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap the illusion of speech follows incidentally
what have you got to say for yourself jimmy as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance
we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down on a crowded bus there was always a to sit
children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty
they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arangement of a neurotic niece in high heels
the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate i envision a thirty six story four hundred and fifty unit residential high
a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission the bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows
the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ that's the end the
serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit
the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry the foreboding sheen of an extra large date
do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed
in poorly labeled roach proof bins pears dried in the form of genital organs
was purchased by maurice haverpiece a wealthy prune juice bottler and consolidated to form the core collection
as an art form it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing
the rest of the collection remains here stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum
and study center a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a
