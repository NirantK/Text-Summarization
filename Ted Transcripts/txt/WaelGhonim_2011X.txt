no one was a hero no one was a hero because everyone was a hero
the largest encyclopedia in the world
from just an idea that sounded crazy you have the largest encyclopedia in the world and in the egyptian revolution the revolution two point zero everyone has contributed something small or big they contributed something
to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions
it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing if you look at the scene egypt for thirty years had been in a downhill
going into a downhill everything was going bad everything was going wrong
we only ranked high when it comes to poverty
corruption lack of freedom of speech lack of political activism
those were the achievements of our great regime
but the reason why everyone was silent
is what i call the psychological barrier of fear
but in fact the majority were scared everyone did not want really to get in trouble
a dictator cannot live without the force they want to make people live in fear
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years
and here comes the internet technology blackberry sms
it 's helping all of us to connect
platforms like youtube twitter facebook were helping us a lot
because it basically gave us the impression that wow i 'm not alone there are a lot of people who are frustrated there are lots of people who are frustrated there are lots of people who actually share the same dream
there are lots of people who care about their freedom they probably have the best life in the world they are living in happiness they are living in their villas they are happy they don 't have problems but they are still
feeling the pain of the egyptian
a lot of us we 're not really happy when we see a video of an egyptian man in june
two thousand and ten i still remember the photo i still remember every single detail of that photo the photo was horrible
he was tortured brutally tortured to death
but then what was the answer of the regime
that was their answer he 's a criminal he 's someone who escaped from all these bad things but people did not relate to this people did not believe this because of the internet
the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth and everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother he was a middle class guy his photo was remembered by all of us a page was created
an anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page and there was no plan what are we going to do i don 't know in a few days tens of thousands of people there
angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs
to just bring them to justice
but of course they don 't listen
it was an amazing story how everyone started feeling the ownership everyone was an owner in this page people started contributing ideas in fact one of the most ridiculous ideas was
hey let 's have a silent stand
let 's get people to go in the street face the sea their back to the street dressed in black standing up silently for one hour doing nothing and then just leaving going back home
but actually when people went to the street the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria
it felt like it was amazing it was great because it connected people from the virtual world bringing them to the real world sharing the same
and things had developed until the tunisian revolution
this whole page was again managed by the people in fact the anonymous admin
job was to collect ideas
help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing people were taking shots and photos people were reporting violations of human rights in egypt people were suggesting ideas they were actually voting on ideas and then they were executing the ideas
people were creating videos everything was done by the people to the people and that 's the power of the internet
i was detained on the twenty seventh night thank god i announced the locations and everything but they detained me
and i 'm not going to talk about my experience because this is not about me i was detained for twelve days blindfolded handcuffed and i did not really hear anything i did not know anything i was not allowed to speak with anyone
seriously with the amount of change i had noticed in this square i thought it was twelve years i never had in my mind to see this egyptian
the amazing egyptian the fear is no longer fear it 's actually strength it 's power people were so empowered it was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights completely opposite extremism became tolerance
this is amazing all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so called propaganda or mainstream media are proven wrong
this whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the egyptian man the egyptian woman how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream when i saw that
i went back and i wrote on facebook
and that was a personal belief
regardless of what 's going on regardless of the details i said that we are going to win
we are going to win because we don 't understand politics we 're going to win because we don 't play their dirty games we 're going to win because we don 't have an agenda we 're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts
we 're going to win because we have dreams we 're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams
and that 's actually what happened we won and that 's not because of anything but because we believed in our dream the winning here is not the whole details of what 's going to happen in the political scene the winning is the winning of the dignity of every single egyptian
actually i had this taxi driver telling me
listen i am breathing freedom
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years for me that 's winning regardless of all the details
egyptians have proven to be true that the power of the people
is much stronger than the people in power thanks
