life evolved under conditions of light and darkness light and then darkness and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in
i'll give you an example if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach and you fly it all the way across the continent and you drop it into a sloped cage
it will scramble up the floor of the cage
as the tide is rising on its home shores and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away
do this for weeks until it kind of gradually loses the
and it's incredible to watch but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond usually with what's going on around it so
we have this ability as well and in humans we call it the body clock
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone 's watch and you shut them into a bunker deep underground for a couple of months people actually volunteer for this and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the
so no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be they all show the same thing they get up just a little bit later every day say fifteen minutes or so
and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks and so in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks rather than somehow sensing the day outside
so fine we have a body clock and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives it's a huge driver for culture and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior
we evolved as a species near the equator and so we're very well equipped to deal with twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness
but of course we've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada where i live we have perpetual daylight in summer and twenty four hours of darkness in winter
so the culture the northern aboriginal culture traditionally has been highly seasonal in winter
so what would our natural rhythm look like what would our sleeping patterns be
again they sleep from about two zero am until sunrise and in between they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed
and during this time there's a surge of prolactin the likes of which a modern day never sees
the people in these studies
so cut to the modern day we're living in a culture of jet lag global travel twenty four hour business shift work
you know our modern ways of doing things have their advantages
but i believe we should
