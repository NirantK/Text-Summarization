to other people in your life how you want to connect to information should it be by just walking around looking down but that was the vision behind glass and that 's why we 've created this form factor
in addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you 're out and about looking at your phone it 's kind of
they were all wearing glass and that 's how we got that footage
and also you want something that frees your eyes that 's why we put the display up high out of your line of sight so it wouldn 't be where you 're looking and it wouldn 't be where you 're making eye contact with people
and also we wanted to free up the ears so the sound actually goes through conducts straight to the bones in your cranium which is a little bit freaky at first but you get used to it and ironically if you want to hear it better you actually just cover your ear
which is kind of surprising but that 's how it works
my vision when we started google fifteen years ago was that eventually you wouldn 't have to have a search query at all you 'd just have information come to you as you needed it and this is now fifteen years later sort of the first
form factor that i think can deliver that vision when you 're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth
this project has lasted now been just over two years we 've learned an amazing amount
it 's been really important to make it comfortable
so our first prototypes we built were huge it was like cell phones strapped to your head it was very heavy pretty uncomfortable we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job and then she almost ran away screaming
but we 've come a long way and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera our original prototypes didn 't have cameras at all
but it 's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family my kids i just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment and lastly i 've realized in experimenting with this device
and with this i know i will get certain messages if i really need them but i don 't have to be checking them all the time
yeah i 've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video
