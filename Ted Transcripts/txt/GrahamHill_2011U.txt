whatever it is must be pretty important because i 've traveled with it moved it from apartment to apartment to
familiar did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did fifty years ago three times
so you 'd think with all this extra space we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff
so where does this lead lots of credit card debt
huge environmental footprints and perhaps not coincidentally our happiness levels flat lined over the same fifty years well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way that less might actually equal more i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less
college in your dorm traveling in a hotel room camping rig up basically nothing maybe a boat whatever it was for you i bet that among other things this gave you a little more freedom a little more time
so i 'm going to suggest that less stuff
and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint it 's actually a great way to save you some money and it 's going to give you a little more ease in your life so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area
first up crowd sourcing my four hundred and twenty sq ft apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto com i wanted it all home office sit down dinner for ten room for guests and all my kite surfing gear
with over three hundred entries from around the world i got it my own little jewel box
by buying a space that was four hundred and twenty sq ft instead of six hundred immediately i 'm saving two hundred grand
smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities save some more money there but also a smaller footprint and because it 's really designed around an edited set of possessions my favorite stuff and really designed for me i 'm really excited to be there
so how can you live little three main approaches first of all you have to edit ruthlessly we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives and that shirt that i hadn 't worn in years
it 's time for me to let it go we 've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives and we 've got to learn to stem the inflow we need to think before we buy ask ourselves is that really going to make me happier truly
by all means we should buy and own some great stuff but we want stuff that we 're going to love for years not just stuff secondly our new mantra
small is sexy we want space efficiency we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time not that rare event why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three
so we want things that nest we want things that stack and we want it digitized you can take paperwork books movies
and you can make it disappear it 's magic finally we want multifunctional spaces and housewares a sink combined with a toilet a dining table becomes a bed same space a little side table stretches out to seat ten
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space look at the coffee table
it grows in height and width to seat ten
my office folds away easily hidden my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers guests move the moving wall have some fold down guest beds and of course my own movie theater
so i 'm not saying that we all need to live in four hundred and twenty sq ft but consider the benefits of an edited life
go from three thousand to two thousand from one thousand five hundred to one thousand most of us maybe all of us are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags maybe a small space a hotel room so when you go home and you walk through your front door take a second and ask yourselves
what 's in the box it doesn 't really matter i know i don 't need it what 's in yours
maybe just maybe less might equal more
