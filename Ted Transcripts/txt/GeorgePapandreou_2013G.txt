the failure of leadership in global politics
and in our globalizing economy and i won 't provide
feel good ready made solutions but i will in the end urge you to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution of democracy
failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today and why is our democracy not working
well i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken
you out of the process so let me from my personal experiences give you an insight so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley
let 's start from the beginning
let 's start from democracy well if you go back to the ancient greeks it was a revelation a discovery that we had the potential together
to be masters of our own fate to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life
and democracy was the political innovation
which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants or of high priests
their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth
well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old i used to to try to avoid homework sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was under control of a very powerful
you can see me here next to him i 'm the younger one there to the side you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
then one night military trucks drive up to our house soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you
my father hiding nearby reveals himself and was summarily taken to prison well we survived but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile
brussels april two thousand and ten i 'm sitting with my counterparts in the european union i had just been elected prime minister
but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government but actually fifteen point six percent
but the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and i had been elected on a mandate a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance
the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system
politics and media captured by special interests
but despite our electoral mandate the markets mistrusted us
our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission
to make the case for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms but time we didn 't get
picture yourselves around the table in brussels negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to finish in ten minutes
no we have to have an agreement now because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy
we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but the markets that put a gun to our collective heads
what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life
painful to me painful to my countrymen imposing cuts austerity often on those not to blame for the crisis
with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse greece yes triggered the euro crisis and some people blame me for pulling the trigger
but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system
vulnerabilities of our democracies our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control
our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes evade environmental or labor standards our democracies are undermined
by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth lobbies corruption
the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential your potential in finding solutions
greece you see was only a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for greece for europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions
instead i had a very humbling experience
in brussels when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us had ever dealt with a similar crisis but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led
by our fears and our fears led to a blind faith
in the orthodoxy of austerity instead of reaching out to the
common or the collective wisdom in our societies investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing
and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn 't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
that was greece those profligate idle ouzo swilling zorba dancing greeks they are the problem punish them
well a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself
but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern
that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex cross border problems whether it 's climate change whether it 's migration whether it 's the financial system
that is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas
taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens
and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process it 's no wonder that many political leaders and i don 't exclude myself
have lost the trust of our people when riot police have to protect parliaments a scene which is
increasingly common around the world then there 's something deeply wrong with our democracies
that 's why i called for a referendum to have the greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can 't do this there will be havoc in the markets again
i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people
since leaving office i have had time to reflect we have weathered the storm in greece and in europe
so far we 've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity
and certainly we could have designed alternatives a different strategy a green stimulus for green jobs or
mutualized debt eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives
again the ancient greeks with all their shortcomings believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs
average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to
decide on critical matters of the day
science theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for participation for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens and those who shunned politics well they were
idiots you see in ancient greece in ancient athens that term originated there idiot comes from the root idio oneself
a person who is self centered secluded excluded someone who doesn 't participate or even examine public affairs
and participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation
you see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people they serve the demos democracy
above government above markets was the direct rule of the people today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions so our politicians are limited to local politics
while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey to forces beyond their control
so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization and i 'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g twenty i 'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values so that we can tap into all of your potential
well this is exactly where i think europe fits in europe despite its recent failures is the world 's most successful cross border peace experiment so let 's see if it can 't be an experiment in global democracy a new kind of democracy
come up with creative solutions let 's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president or citizen juries
chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues a european wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties
and here 's an idea
why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or swedish citizenship but a european citizenship
and make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe
where our common identity is
democracy where our education is through participation and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia europe of and by the people a europe
an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders now some might accuse me of being naive
putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people
well after decades in politics i am also a pragmatist
believe me i have been i am part of today 's political system and i know things must change
we must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign for a better world
but i also know that this disruptive force of change won 't be driven by the politics of today
the revival of democratic politics will come from you and i mean all of you
everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it 's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally where everybody lives everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy
dogma rather than critical thinking technocracy rather than democracy everyone who stands up to the unchecked power whether it 's authoritarian leaders plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens
or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few
it is in their interest that all of us are idiots let 's not be thank you
help us understand how you felt after the decision it was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as george
me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem and that hurt that hurt because that first of all hurt the younger generation and not only
many of them are demonstrating outside but i think this is one of our problems when we face these crises
we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and we are closing in on ourselves in politics and i think we need to change that to really find new participatory ways
using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have and i think we can find solutions which are much better but we have to be open
the paradox is that because we have this blame game
we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together
while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together now more europe for me is not simply giving more power to brussels it is actually giving more power to the citizens of europe that is
really making europe a project of the people so that i think would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society
