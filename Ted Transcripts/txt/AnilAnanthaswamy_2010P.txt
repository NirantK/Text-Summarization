the universe and dr einstein a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle a few years after that in bangalore i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night and i picked up this book thinking it would put me to sleep in ten minutes
and as it happened i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration
trigger for me to actually change my career from being a software engineer to become a science writer so that i could partake in the joy of science and also the joy of communicating it to others
and that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes detectors instruments that people are building or have built
in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail so it took me from places like chile the atacama desert in chile to siberia to underground mines in the japanese alps in northern america
all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole and today i would like to share with you some images some stories of these trips i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who
are putting literally at times their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe and
properly explain what is called normal matter the stuff that we 're all made of and that 's four percent of the universe astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that
there is something called dark matter in the universe which makes up
twenty three percent of the universe and something called dark energy which permeates the fabric of space time that makes up
another seventy three percent so if you look at this pie chart ninety six percent of the universe at this point in our exploration of it is unknown or not well understood and most of the experiments telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy
i will take you first to an underground mine in northern minnesota
where people are looking for something called dark matter and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors
and the reason why they have to go underground is that if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays ambient radio activity even our own bodies you might not believe it but even our own bodies are radioactive enough
to disturb this experiment so they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector and
i went to see one of these experiments and this is actually you can barely see it and the reason for that is it 's entirely dark in there this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners
who left this mine in one thousand nine hundred and sixty and physicists came and started using it sometime in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and the miners in the early part of the last century worked literally in candlelight and today you would see this inside the mine half a mile underground this is one of the largest underground labs in the world and among other things they 're looking for dark matter
there is another way to search for dark matter which is indirectly if dark matter exists in our universe in our galaxy then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about one of them being neutrinos and neutrinos you can detect
by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light a flash of blue light and by looking for this blue light you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then indirectly something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino
but you need very very large volumes of water in order to do this
you need something like tens of megatons of water almost a gigaton of water in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino and where in the world would you find such water well the russians have a tank in their own backyard this is lake baikal it is the largest lake in the world it 's eight hundred km long
it 's about forty to fifty km wide in most places and one to two kilometers deep and what the russians are doing is they 're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light
and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there this is lake baikal in the
peak of the siberian winter the lake is entirely frozen and the line of black dots that you see
in the background that 's the ice camp where the physicists are working the reason why they have to work in winter is because they don 't have the money to work in summer and spring which if they did that they would need ships and submersibles to do their work so they wait until winter
the lake is completely frozen over and they use this meter thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work so this is the russians working
on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter they have to drill holes in the ice dive down into the water cold cold water to get hold of the instrument bring it up do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do
put it back and get out before the ice melts because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it 's full of cracks and you have to imagine there 's an entire sea like lake underneath moving i still don 't understand this one russian man working in his bare chest but that tells you how hard he was working
just to give you an idea they have spent twenty million over twenty years it 's very harsh conditions they work on a shoestring budget the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack
and it 's that basic but they do this every year
from siberia to the atacama desert in chile to see something called the very large telescope the very large telescope is one of these things that astronomers do they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively i can tell you for a fact that the next one that they 're planning is called the extremely large telescope
what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror
each mirror there are four of them is made of a single piece of glass a monolithic piece of high tech ceramic that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is to imagine a city like paris
with all its buildings and the eiffel tower if you grind down paris to that kind of accuracy
and that 's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured an extraordinary set of telescopes here 's another view of the same the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert
the dry air is really good for telescopes and also the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about three hundred days of clear skies
finally i want to take you to antarctica i want to spend most of my time on this part of the world this is cosmology 's final frontier some of the most amazing experiments some of the most extreme experiments are being done in antarctica i was there to view something called a long duration balloon flight
which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper
that 's where they do their experiments and then the balloon the payload is brought down so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica that 's an american c seventeen cargo plane that flew us from
new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica and here we are about to board our bus and i don 't know if you can read the lettering but it says ivan the terribus
and that 's taking us to mcmurdo and this is the scene that greets you in mcmurdo and you barely might be able to make out this hut here this hut was built by
robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole
because it 's so cold the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there it 's an extraordinary place
this is mcmurdo itself about a thousand people work here in summer and about two hundred in winter when it 's completely dark for six months i was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument
this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper stratosphere to an altitude of forty km what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight so you 're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way
what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon
the fabric parachute and everything on the ice and then fill it up with helium and that process takes about two hours and the weather can change as they 're putting together this whole assembly for instance here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind which is eventually going to be filled up with helium those two trucks you see at the very end
carry twelve tanks each of compressed helium now in case the weather changes before the launch they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to mcmurdo station
the fabric alone weighs two tons in order to minimize the weight it 's very thin it 's as thin as a sandwich wrapper and if they have to pack it back they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it
so that it fits into the box again except when they did it first it would have been done in texas here they can 't do it with the kind shoes they 're wearing so they have to take their shoes off get barefoot into the boxes in this cold and do that kind of work that 's the kind of dedication these people have here 's the balloon being filled up with helium
and you can see it 's a gorgeous sight
here 's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end to end so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left hand side and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there 's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute and then the parachute is then connected to the payload
and remember all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold in sub zero temperatures they 're wearing about fifteen kg of clothing and stuff but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that and i would like to share with you a launch
this is a close up of the buddhist monastery and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two
enormous disciplines that humanity has one is exploring the cosmos on the outside and the other one is exploring our interior being
and both require silence of some sort and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence whether it 's silence from radio pollution or light pollution
or whatever and it was very obvious that if we destroy these silent places on earth we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space thank you
