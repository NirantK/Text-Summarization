last year when i was here i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole and while that swim took place three years ago i can remember it as if it was yesterday i remember standing on the edge of the ice about to dive into the water
and thinking to myself i have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening the water is completely black
the water is minus one point seven degrees centigrade or twenty nine degrees fahrenheit it's flipping freezing in that water
and then a thought came across my mind if things go pear shaped on this swim how long will it take for my frozen body
to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean and then i said to myself i've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible and the only way i can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer
by listening to my ipod and really revving myself up listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to puff daddy and then committing myself a hundred percent there is nothing more powerful than the made up
and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water and that swim took me eighteen minutes and fifty seconds and it felt like eighteen days
because you know we're made partially of water when water freezes it expands and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following
i'm never ever going to do another cold water
in my life again anyway last year i heard about the himalayas and the melting of
and left in its place this big lake and i firmly believe that what we're seeing in the himalayas is the next great big battleground
on this earth nearly two billion people so one in three people on this earth rely on the water from the himalayas and with a population increasing as quickly as it is
and so i decided to walk up to mt everest the highest mountain on this earth and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of mt everest
now i don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt everest but it's quite an ordeal getting up there twenty eight great big powerful yaks
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude i wanted to do the swim at five thousand three hundred meters above sea level so it's right up in the heavens it's very very difficult to breath you get altitude sickness
was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt everest many many people have died on mt everest and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain
and when you're walking up the mountain to
to do something which no human has ever done before and in fact no fish there are no fish up there swimming at five thousand three hundred meters when you're trying to do that and then the bodies are coming past you it humbles you
and you also realize very very clearly that nature
is so much more powerful than we are
and we walked up this pathway all the way up and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice and then we got up to this
i put on my ipod i listened to some music i got myself as aggressive as possible but controlled aggression and then i hurled myself into that water
i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters and then i realized very very quickly i had a huge problem on my hands i could barely breathe i was gasping for air i then began to choke
and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water and it all happened so quickly
i then i don't know how it happened but i went underwater and luckily the water was quite shallow and i was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take
of air and then i said carry on carry on carry on i carried on for another five or six strokes and then i had nothing in my body and i went down to the bottom of the lake
and i don't where i got it from but i was able to somehow pull myself
and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake i've heard it said
i got myself to the side of the lake my crew
me and then we walked as quickly as we could down over the rubble down to our camp and there
we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt everest
and my team just gave it to me straight
they said lewis you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim
every single thing which you have learned in the past twenty three years of swimming you must forget every single thing which
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days time take some time to rest and think about things we want you to walk
up the mountain in two days time and instead of swimming fast swim as slowly as possible instead of swimming crawl swim breaststroke
and remember never ever swim with aggression this is the time to swim with real humility and so we walked back up
to the mountain two days later
and i stood there on the edge of the lake
and i looked up at mt everest and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth and i said to myself
just do this slowly and i swam across the lake
of sherpas who taught me this the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well doesn't mean it's going to work in the future
now before i do anything i ask myself what type of mindset do i require to successfully
and taking that into the world of climate change which is frankly the mt everest of all problems
just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long
doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on the warning signs are all there when i was born the world 's population was three point five billion people
and i've come here to ask you today
can you take in your relationship to the environment
which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world and most importantly in a sustainable world and i ask you please to go away from here
and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make which will make that big difference
and then commit a hundred percent to doing it blog about it tweet about it talk about it and commit a hundred percent
because very very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it so thank you very very much
