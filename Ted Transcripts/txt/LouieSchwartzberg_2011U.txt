here at ted you know i think there might be some presentations that will go over my head but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet
the little things in life sometimes that we forget about like pollination that we take for granted
and you can 't tell the story about pollinators bees bats hummingbirds butterflies without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co evolved over fifty million years i 've been filming time lapse flowers twenty four hours a day seven days a week for over thirty five years
to watch them move is a dance i 'm never going to get tired of it fills me with wonder and it opens my heart beauty and seduction i believe is nature 's tool for survival
because we will protect what we fall in love with their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth
it reminds us that we are a part of nature and we 're not separate from it
when i heard about the vanishing bees colony collapse disorder it motivated me to take action we depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat and many scientists believe it 's the most serious issue facing mankind
it 's like the canary in the coalmine if they disappear so do we
it reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it
what motivated me to film their behavior was something that i asked my scientific advisers what motivates the pollinators well their answer was
it 's all about risk and reward like a wide eyed kid i 'd say why is that
and they 'd say well because they want to survive
and that blew my mind because i realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life rarely seen by the naked eye
this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment
it 's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself over and over again
so here is some nectar from my film i hope you 'll drink tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden and always take time to smell the flowers and let it fill you with beauty and rediscover that sense of wonder here are some images
