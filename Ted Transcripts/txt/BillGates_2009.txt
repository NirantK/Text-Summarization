last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing
a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive
the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care
and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning i'm going to share two of these problems and talk about
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist any tough problem i think it can be solved
part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past
over the past century average lifespan has more than doubled
another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths
five years ago one hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five
so that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate it's a phenomenal thing each one of those lives matters a lot
and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely
well under twenty years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia
actually peaked at a bit over five million in the nineteen thirties so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world a terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe
people didn't know what caused it until the early nineteen hundreds when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere
two tools helped bring the death rate down one was
killing the mosquitoes with ddt the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries
it doesn't get much investment
for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria
now baldness it's a terrible
and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set
but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it
it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much
now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes i brought some here just so you could experience this we'll let those roam around the the
those mosquitoes are not infected
so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are
a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can't get at them
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over fifty percent
and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria
and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking
or if you go in kind of half heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden
but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing
bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months
over two thirds of the lives if it's effective so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the road map
it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets but ninety percent
we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise
we need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria
let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but i'd say equally important
and this is how do you make a teacher great
let 's start with why this is important
well all of us here i'll bet had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful
i can say that even though i'm a college drop out i had great teachers in fact in the united states the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers
in a narrow set of places so the top twenty percent of students have gotten a good education and those top twenty percent
have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront
now the strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting
not only has that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy
it really is only providing opportunities now
to people with a better education and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like science and mathematics
when i first learned the statistics i was pretty stunned at how bad things are over thirty percent of kids never finish high school
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and
the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over thirty percent for minority kids it's over fifty percent
and even if you graduate from high school
if you're low income you have less than a twenty five percent chance of ever completing a college degree
if you're low income in the united states you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree
and that doesn't seem entirely fair
so how do you make education better
our foundation for the last nine years has invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we've funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect
but the more we looked at it the more we realized
having great teachers was the very key thing
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom
how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher
will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over ten percent in a single year what does that mean that means that if the entire u s
for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away
within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need are those top quartile teachers
and so you'd say wow we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing
and transfer that skill to other people but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today
you might think these are people with master 's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their master 's of education
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master 's degree
now the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension the second is
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher
teach for america slight effect for math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this
and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system
now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made
a good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp kipp means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have sixty six schools mostly middle schools some high schools
and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over ninety six percent of their high school graduates go
to four year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different
in the normal public schools they're team teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase they're deeply engaged in making teaching better
actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and
i thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy level was high i thought i 'm in the sports rally or something what's going on
and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade
keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who a normal school teachers
how good they are the data isn't gathered
in the teacher 's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year
and they need advanced notice to do that so imagine running a factory where you've got these workers some of them just making
crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment
even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it
they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example new york passed a law
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers
but i'm optimistic about this i think there are some clear things we can do
first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand
that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well
little clip of something i think i did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that and they could all sit and work together on those problems
you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course
learn from that if you have a kid who 's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that dvds were always
available and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers
and so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better
and i thought it was so fantastic it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book
i really think that education is the most important thing to get right
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the house version actually had money in it for these data systems
and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things but i i'm optimistic i think people are beginning to recognize
how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right
only had time to frame those two problems there's a lot more problems like that
see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen
governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved
and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that i think there's some great things that will come out of it
