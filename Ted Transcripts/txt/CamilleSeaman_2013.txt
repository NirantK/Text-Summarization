as a shinnecock indian i was raised to know this we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york
when i was a little girl
my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day
there were no clouds in the sky
and after a while i began to perspire
and he pointed up to the sky
that feeds the plants that feeds the animals
in my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life
i started storm chasing in two thousand and eight after my daughter said mom you should do that
and so three days later driving very fast
i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super
capable of producing grapefruit size hail
and spectacular tornadoes although only two percent actually do
these clouds can grow so big
and reach up to sixty five thousand feet into the atmosphere
they can grow so big blocking all daylight making it very dark and ominous standing under them
storm chasing is a very tactile experience
there 's a warm moist wind blowing at your back
and the smell of the earth the wheat the grass the charged particles
and then there are the colors in the clouds
i 've learned to respect the lightning
my hair used to be straight
the way they swirl and spin and undulate with their lava lamp like mammatus clouds they become lovely monsters
when i 'm photographing them i cannot help but remember my grandfather 's lesson
as i stand under them i see not just a cloud but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces the same process in a small scale version that helped to create our galaxy our solar system
our sun and even this very planet
all my relations thank you
