the first question is this our country has two exploration programs one is
with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we're lucky and you can see we have sputnik and we have a saturn and we have other manifestations of space exploration
and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans here 's the reason or not the reason but here 's why i ask that question if you compare
would fund noaa 's budget to explore the oceans for one thousand six hundred years
why why are we looking up is it because it's heaven
and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean
or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer
i'm going to take you on a sixteen minute trip
on seventy two percent of the planet so buckle up ok
we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned of marshall kay 's geosynclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap
in today 's context it was a bunch of crap but it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans
mostly discoveries made by accident
i have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it's a map it is not a map
fact i have another version at my office and i ask people why are there mountains here on this area here but there are none over here
and they go well gee i don't know saying is it a fracture zone is it a hot spot no no that's the only place a ship
most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored
we had more exploration ships down there during captain cook 's time than now
it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the seventy two percent of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the easter bunny put all the resources
you know it's just ludicrous
we are always constantly playing the zero sum game you know we're going to take it away from something else i believe in just enriching the economy
and we're leaving so much on the table seventy two percent of the planet and as i will point out later in the presentation fifty percent lies beneath the sea
i began my explorations the hard way back then actually my first expedition was when i was seventeen years old it was forty nine years ago do the math i'm sixty six and i went out to sea on a scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a
giant rogue wave and i was too young to be you know i thought it was great i was a body surfer and i thought wow that was an incredible wave
and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight in fact on a good day we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth
this is on a mercator projection but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid ocean ridge covers twenty three percent of the earth 's total surface area almost a quarter of our
to the moon played golf up there before
we went to the largest feature on our own planet
and our interest in this mountain range as earth scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet
but the role it plays in the genesis of the earth 's outer skin because it's along the axis of the mid ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a living organism you tear it open it bleeds its molten blood
rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere hardens forms new tissue and moves laterally but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it into the rift valley until a group of seven of us
it's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is twelve thousand feet in the rift valley it's nine thousand feet most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun
most of our planet is in eternal darkness
and for that reason you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea and with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought
and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire forty two thousand miles
running along this entire forty two thousand miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude
so it's a phenomenally active region it's not just a dark boring place it's a very alive place and it's then being ripped open
but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then we couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense
they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you'd uplift it that's why you get you know you get sea shells up on mount everest it's not a flood it was pushed up there
we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension it should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister
was missing heat it was hot it wasn't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there's little green people down there taking it there's all sorts of things going on but the only logical was that there were hot springs so there must be
pilot made this great observation that 's hot
then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature was six hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead this is what a real one looks like on the juan de fuca ridge what you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean
and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range we're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed
by what we discovered we discovered a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist
giant tube worms ten feet tall i remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock
large clams and when we opened them they didn't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn't have the anatomy of a clam no mouth no gut no digestive system
their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks
none of this in our textbooks we did not know about this life system we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat
so we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from this silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean twelve thousand feet two and half hours
to get to work in the morning two and half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile
on a forty two thousand mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so i began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so i wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system
we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies again looking for something else
but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand that did not make sense they were not above a magma chamber they shouldn 't be there and we called it lost city
and lost city was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools look at that how do you do that
that's water upside down we went in underneath and tapped it and we found that it had the ph of
the ph of eleven and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment and the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a ph of eleven life existed so life was much more
them in the caldera nearby we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were
to the existence of this system again you know we stop at the water
finding pools of water this
time not upside down right side up bingo you'd think you're in air until a fish swims by you're looking at
brine pools formed by salt diapirs near that was methane i've never seen volcanoes of methane
instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by i've never seen this before
moving on there's more than just natural history beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the titanic the realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on earth
it contains more history than all of the museums on land combined and yet we're only now penetrating it finding the state of preservation we found the bismarck in sixteen thousand feet
we then found the yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship it said yorktown on the stern
more recently finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the number 's a million we've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they're not supposed to be this shipwreck sank
and then here 's one that sank at the time of homer at seven hundred and fifty b c more recently into the black sea where we're exploring because there's no oxygen there it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulphide on earth
look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter look at the state of those artifacts you still see the bees wax dripping when they dropped they sealed it this ship sank one thousand five hundred years ago
been able to convince congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the united states navy
its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet earth and i was looking at it
it's up in seattle ok it comes online this
and it begins its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology but certainly it's going to be going to the unknown america
this is that part of the united states that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like i say particularly the western territorial trust we don't have maps of them
an ancient shipwreck a phoenician off brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center
a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the university of rhode island called the interspace center and within that we're going to run it just like you run a
in the command center a second later but then it's connected through internet too the new internet highway that makes internet one and look like a dirt road on the information highway with ten gigabits of bandwidth
go into areas we have no knowledge of it's a big blank sheet on our planet we'll map it within hours have the maps disseminated out
to the major universities it turns out that ninety percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at twelve universities they're all on i
we can then build a command center this is a remote center at the university of washington she's talking to the pilot she's five thousand miles away but she's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children
we can disseminate they can follow this expedition i've started a program where are you jim jim young who helped start a program called the jason project more recently we've started a program
with the boys and girls clubs of america so that we can use exploration and the excitement of live exploration to motivate them and excite them
and then give them what they're already ready for i would not let an adult drive my robot you don't have enough gaming experience but i
let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system
because we want to create we
because this is what we want this is what we want
young lady not watching a football game not watching a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away and it's just dawning on her
what she's seeing and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it's in full recept mode
this i hope will be a
future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth and my final question my final question
why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build habitation on mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon
but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet and the technology is at hand thank you very much
