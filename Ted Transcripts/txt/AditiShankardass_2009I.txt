when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school
and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands
and there it was the seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body sitting in my hands
and that day i knew that when i grew up i was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other
years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while i was doing my ph d on the neurological causes
of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i'd like to share with you all today
it is estimated that one in six children that's one in six children suffer from some developmental disorder
this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder
but here 's what really perplexed me despite the fact that each and every one these disorders originates in the brain
most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart
it seemed so intuitive to me to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately it would be necessary to look at the brain directly
looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child 's problems
yet despite all the advances in medical technology the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children
their groundbreaking technology records the eeg or the electrical activity of the brain in real time
allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions vision attention language
a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain
and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether
any of these abnormalities are clinically significant allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team
like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by abc news seven year old justin senigar
came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body
there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially and he would probably never have too much language
when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling
it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures
that were impossible to see with the naked eye but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism
after justin was given anti seizure medication the change in him was amazing within a period of sixty days his vocabulary went from two to three words to three hundred words
and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled in a regular school and even became a karate superchamp
research shows that fifty percent of children almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures
these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin all these children
came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems instead
scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments
so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment
for too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to
and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience one in which we can finally look directly at brain function
in real time with no risks and no side effects non invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children
so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder
then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved one more mind will be unlocked and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system
will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves thank you
