i want to imagine that in one case the sperm is carrying a y chromosome meeting that x chromosome of the egg
and in the other case the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg
both are viable both take off
in most of what i do as the one hat i do history of anatomy i 'm a historian by training and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning human bodies animal bodies how they dealt with bodily fluids concepts of bodies how have they thought about bodies
in that case what i 've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms so some of what i 've worked on for example is people who are conjoined twins two people within one body
and a lot of what i 've worked on is people who have atypical sex so people who don 't have the standard male or the standard female body types and as a general term we can use the term intersex for this
intersex comes in a lot of different forms i 'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn 't standard for male or female
so in one instance you can have somebody who has an xy chromosomal basis
and that sry gene on the y chromosome tells the proto gonads which we all have in the fetal life to become testes and so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone but because this individual lacks
receptors to hear that testosterone the body doesn 't react to the testosterone and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome
so lots of levels of testosterone but no reaction to it as a consequence the body develops more along the female typical path when the child is born she looks like a girl
but she 's not getting her period that somebody figures out something 's up here and they do some tests and figure out that instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus she actually has testes inside and she has a y chromosome now what 's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male but they 're really not
females like males have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands they 're in the back of our body and the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone
most females like me i believe myself to be a typical female i don 't actually know my chromosomal make up but i think i 'm probably typical most females like me are actually androgen sensitive we 're making androgen and we 're responding to androgens the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens
so sex is really complicated it 's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was nineteen years old
he had xx chromosomes and in the womb his adrenal glands were in such high gear
that it created essentially a masculine hormonal environment and as a consequence his genitals were masculinzed his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones
and he was born looking like a boy nobody suspected anything and it was only when he had reached the age of nineteen that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally that doctors figured out
that in fact he was female internally okay so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular
so sex can come in lots of different varieties
in many cases people are actually perfectly healthy the reason they 're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories
and our nation 's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body
i had a lot of journalists calling me asking me
which is the test they 're going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female
and i had to explain to the journalists there isn 't such a test in fact
we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn 't draw the line for us between male and female or between male and intersex and female and intersex we actually draw that line on nature
so what we have is a sort of situation where
the farther our science goes the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought
and it 's not just in terms of sex it 's also in terms of race which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed
as we look we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas we look for example about the fact that we share at least ninety five percent of our dna with chimpanzees what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides
and as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we 've had are probably overly simplistic
so we 're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life one of the places we 're seeing it for example in our culture today in the united states today is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life
we have very difficult conversations nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine about the question of when somebody 's dead in the past our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead at most they 'd stick a feather on somebody 's nose and if it twitched they didn 't bury them yet if it stopped twitching
now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy i 'm a political progressive i defend people with unusual bodies but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought
makes me tense and it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy so in order to tell you about that tension i have to first admit to you that i 'm a huge fan of the founding fathers
i know they were racists i know they were sexist but they were great i mean they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical one thousand seven hundred and seventy six every few years and it 's not because of the music which is totally forgettable it 's because of what happened in one thousand seven hundred and seventy six with the founding fathers
what they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for two hundred years so as you all recall what our founding fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy the monarchs of the old world
didn 't have a concept of dna but they did have a concept of birthright they had a concept of blue blood they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth
the founding fathers rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical
and that was democracy growing up
but it was also science growing up at the same time
and it 's really clear if you look at the history of the founding fathers a lot of them were very interested in science and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world they were moving away from supernatural explanations and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept and if you look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and nature 's god
they don 't talk about god and god 's nature they 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are
happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote
took the founding fathers concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn 't have the right to vote the right to full citizenship the right to own property etc etc and women successfully argued that
next came the successful civil rights movement where we found people like sojourner truth talking about ain 't i a woman we find men on the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying i
again people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy again successfully we see the same thing with the disability rights movement
now mind you i want to maintain some divisions anatomically in our culture for example i don 't want to give a fish the same rights as a human
i don 't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy i don 't want to say five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense
to me and that i think we should retain but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning so let 's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk
the right to vote the right to drink
henry has to wait for all of that not because he 's actually any different in age biologically except in terms of when he was born
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven 't told you that he 's the xy one
henry can marry in every state a woman but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman so we have these anatomical categories that persist might start falling apart
i don 't want to give up the science but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us so where do we go
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude well we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position so for example texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don 't have a y chromosome
and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a y chromosome now in practice they don 't actually test people for their chromosomes but this is also very bizarre because of the story i told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy dr martin luther king he offers us something of a solution in his i have a dream speech he says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character moving beyond anatomy and i want to say yeah that sounds like a really good idea but in practice how do you do it
intelligent mature decisions about sexual relations than some forty year olds that i know so how do we operationalize the question of content of character it turns out to be really difficult and part of me also wonders what if content of character turns out to be something that 's scannable
do we really want to go there
i 'm not sure where we go what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of
the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy we 've done a really good job struggling with democracy and i think we would do a good job in the future we don 't have a situation that iran has for example where a man who 's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered unless he 's willing to submit to a sex change in which case he 's allowed
to live we don 't have that kind of situation i 'm glad to say we don 't have the kind of situation with
my response to him was well have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state so i think we have to be in the lead
well just to close i want to suggest to you that i 've been talking a lot about the fathers and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or might have looked like if we had more involved the mothers
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups
now for years because i 've been interested in intersex i 've also been interested in sex difference research and one of the things that i 've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world
and what we know from cross cultural studies is that females on average not everyone but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group
one of my graduate advisers who knew i was interested in feminism i considered myself a feminist as i still do asked a really strange question he said
tell me what 's feminine about feminism
and i thought well that 's the dumbest question i 've ever heard feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so there 's nothing feminine about feminism but the more i thought about his question the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism that is to say there might be something on average different about female brains from male brains
that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable
so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out
how to protect individuals from the state it 's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other
and maybe that 's where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity and think more about those relationships so that as we
