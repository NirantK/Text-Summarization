my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world and i do that quite regularly and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places i'm really struck by the things that we have in common
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful to be healthy and to have a successful life
but i also see lots of poverty and it's quite jarring
both in the scale and the scope of it my first trip in india i was in a person 's home where they had dirt floors no running water no electricity and that's really what i see all over the world
so in short i'm startled by all the things that they don't
but i am surprised by one thing that they do have
coke is everywhere in fact when i travel to the developing world coke feels ubiquitous
and so when i come back from these trips and i'm thinking about development and i'm flying home and i'm thinking we 're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations you know coke 's success
stops and makes you wonder how is it that they can get coke to these far flung places if they can do that why can't governments and ngos do the same thing and i'm not the first person to ask this question
but i think as a community we still have a lot to learn it's staggering if you think about coca cola they sell one point five billion servings every single day
that's like every man woman and child on the planet having a serving of coke every week so why does this matter
well if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we're set as a world we need to learn from the innovators and those innovators come from every single sector
i feel that if we can understand what makes something like coca cola ubiquitous we can apply those lessons then for the public good
i think there are really three things we can take away from coca cola they take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent and they do incredible marketing so let 's start with the data
coke has a very clear bottom line they report to a set of shareholders they have to turn a profit so they take the data and they use it to measure progress
they have this very continuous feedback loop they learn something they put it back into the product they put it back into the market they have a whole team called knowledge and insight it's a lot like other consumer companies
so if sales start to drop then the person can identify the problem and address the issue
let 's contrast that for a minute to development
in development the evaluation comes at the very end of the project i've sat in a lot of those meetings and by then it is way too late to use the data
i had somebody from an ngo once describe it to me as bowling in the dark they said you roll the ball you hear some pins go down it's dark you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on and then you an see your impact real time data
turns on the lights so
they couldn't reach the distant markets because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world which was a large truck rolling down the street and in africa the remote places it's hard to find a good road
but coke noticed something they noticed that local people were taking the product buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard to reach places and so they took a bit of time to learn about that
and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product
there are now some three thousand of these centers employing about fifteen thousand people in africa in tanzania and uganda they represent ninety percent
of coke 's sales let 's look at the development side what is it that governments and ngos can learn from coke
i think a great example of this is ethiopia 's new health extension program
the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic they were over a day 's travel away from a health clinic so if you're in an emergency situation or if you're a mom about it deliver a baby forget it to get to the health care center
they decided that wasn't good enough so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this and they adapted it for ethiopia
and in two thousand and three the government of ethiopia started this new system in their own country they trained thirty five thousand health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people
now think about how this can change people 's lives
health extension workers can help with so many things whether it's family planning prenatal care immunizations for the children or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down twenty five percent from two thousand to two thousand and eight
in ethiopia there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program
so what's the next step for ethiopia well they're already starting talk about this they're starting to talk about how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas
how do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages that's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people 's potential
the third component of coke 's success is marketing ultimately coke 's success depends on one crucial fact
and that is that people want a coca cola
now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow so they rely on coca cola
in terms of its marketing and what's the secret to their marketing well it's aspirational it is associates that product with a kind of life that people want to live
so even though it's a global company they take a very local approach
coke 's global campaign slogan is open happiness but they localize it and they don't just guess what makes people happy
they go to places like latin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life and in south africa they associate happiness with or community respect
now that played itself out in the world cup campaign let 's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin flag by a somali hip hop artist
it reminds me of a song that i remember from my childhood i 'd like to teach the world to
also went number one on the pop charts
both songs have something in common that same appeal of celebration and unity
so how does health and development market
well it's based on avoidance not aspirations i'm sure you've heard some of these messages use a condom don't get aids wash you hands you might not get diarrhea
it doesn't sound anything like wavin flag to me and i think we make a fundamental mistake we make an assumption that we think that if people need something
we don't have to make them want that and i think that's a mistake and there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change one example is sanitation
we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation but there's a solution you build a toilet
but what we're finding around the world over and over again is if you build a toilet and you leave it there it doesn't get used people reuse it for a slab for their home they sometimes store grain in it i've even seen it used for a chicken coop
but what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea
you work with the community you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn 't be done in the village and they agree to that but then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern trendy convenience
one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship and it works look at these headlines
i'm not kidding women are refusing to marry men without toilets no loo no i do now
they're waiting to be circumcised can you you believe that
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by sixty percent in men and when we first heard this result inside the foundation i have to
so if we can start to understand
what people really want in health and development
we can change communities and we can change whole nations
let 's talk about what happens when this all comes together when you tie the three things together
and polio i think is one of the most powerful examples we've seen a ninety nine percent reduction in polio in twenty years
let 's look at a country like india they have over a billion people in this country
but they have thirty five thousand local doctors who report paralysis and clinicians a huge reporting system in chemists they have two and a half million vaccinators
but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you let me tell you the story of shriram an eighteen month boy in bihar a northern state in india this year on august eighth he felt paralysis and on the thirteenth his parents took him to the doctor
on august fourteenth and fifteenth they took a stool sample and by the twenty fifth of august it was confirmed he had type one polio by august thirtieth a genetic test was done and we knew what strain of polio shriram had
now it could have come from one of two places it could have come from nepal just to the north across the border or from jharkhand a state just to the south
luckily the genetic testing proved that in fact this strand came north because had it come from the south it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission so many more people would have been affected
so what's the endgame well on september fourth there was a huge mop up campaign which is what you do in polio they went out and where shriram lives they vaccinated two million people
so in less than a month we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program and i'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio
that's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands they can save lives
now one of the challenges in polio still is marketing but it might not be what you think it's not the marketing on the ground it's not telling the parents if you see paralysis take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated
we have a problem with marketing in the donor community the g eight nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last twenty years
but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer so by next summer we're sighted to run out of money on
so we are ninety nine percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money
and i think that if the marketing were more aspirational if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease
we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us and if we could do that we could stop vaccinating everybody worldwide in all of our countries for polio and it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet
and we are so close and this victory is so possible
so if coke 's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms
to me that is deep happiness
that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as coca cola thank you
