fifteen years ago after a twenty year stay in the united states and africa called me back
and i founded my country 's first graphic design and new media college and i called it the zimbabwe institute of vigital arts the idea the dream was really for a sort of bauhaus sort of school
we offer a two year diploma
to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education and typography 's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence
here 's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme education is a right
some logos designed by my students africa has had a long tradition of writing but this is not such a well known fact and i wrote the book afrikan alphabets to address that the different types of writing in africa first was proto writing
so it 's a special interest writing system
the akan of people of ghana and cote d 'ivoire developed adinkra symbols some four hundred years ago
and these are proverbs historical sayings objects animals plants and my favorite adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left it 's called sankofa it means return and get it
learn from the past this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world at the top is god at the bottom is man mankind
and on the left is the sun on the right is the moon all the paths lead to and from god
these secret societies of the yoruba kongo and palo
religions in nigeria congo and angola respectively
developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the new world in cuba
in the ituri society the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree and the women who are also the praise singers paint interweaving patterns that are the same in structure as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing
a sort of a musical score if you may
in south africa ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors and the zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces
king ibrahim njoya of the bamum kingdom of cameroon developed shu mom at the age of twenty five
africa has had a long tradition of design a well defined design sensibility but the problem in africa has been that especially today designers in africa
struggle with all forms of design because
they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration
the creative spirit in africa the creative tradition is as potent as it has always been if only designers could look within
this ethiopic cross illustrates what dr ron eglash has established that africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals africans of antiquity created civilization
and their monuments which still stand today are a true testimony of their greatness
most probably one of humanity 's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet and that has been attributed to mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in one thousand six hundred bc followed by hieroglyphics in egypt
and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact
and these have been dated at between one thousand eight hundred and one thousand nine hundred b c centuries before mesopotamia called wadi el hol because of the place that they were discovered
these inscriptions research is still going on a few of them have been deciphered but there is consensus among scholars that this is really humanity 's first alphabet
students of design in africa read the works of
titans like cheikh anta diop senegal 's cheikh anta diop whose seminal work on egypt is vindicated by this discovery
the last word goes to the great jamaican leader marcus mosiah garvey and the akan people of ghana with their adinkra symbol sankofa which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children
it is also time that designers in africa stop looking outside
they 've been looking outward for a long time yet what they were looking for
