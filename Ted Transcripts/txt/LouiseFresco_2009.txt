i'm not at all a cook so don't fear this is not going to be a cooking demonstration but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us and that is bread
one of these californian low carb diets bread is standard bread is not only standard in the western diet as i will show to you it is actually the mainstay of modern life
so i'm going to bake bread for you in the meantime i'm also talking to you so my life is going to complicated bear with me first of all a little bit of audience
i didn't know this word until i arrived
and this is more or less a whole meal handmade small bakery loaf of bread
here we go i want to see a show of hands who prefers the whole meal bread
okay let me do this differently is anybody preferring the wonderbread at all tentative male hands
the question is really why is this so and i think it is because we feel that this kind of
really is about authenticity it's about a traditional way of living a way that is perhaps more real more honest
this is an image from tuscany where we feel agriculture is still about beauty and life is really too and this is about good taste good traditions
why do we have this image why do we feel that this is more true than this well i think it has a lot to do with our history
in the ten thousand years since agriculture evolved most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production
and we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past art has helped us to maintain that kind of
it was a mythical past of course the reality is quite different these poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals
had yield levels that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in west africa but we have somehow in the course of the last few
centuries or even decades started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past
only two hundred years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution and while i'm starting to make some bread for you here
it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us it brought us power it brought
all that is a real great improvement as we shall see of course we also particularly in the last decade
and it means that you now eat products which can come from all around the world that is the reality of our modern life now you may prefer this loaf of bread excuse my hands but this is how it is
but actually the real relevant bread historically is this white wonder loaf and don't despise the white bread because
i think symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all
we are not really conscious of that much but it has changed the world this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world
so what is happening well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last
few decades since the nineteen sixties food availability per head in this world has increased by twenty five percent
and the world population in the meantime has doubled that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history
and that is the result directly of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production
and this is true as you can see for all countries including the so called developing countries what happened to our bread in the meantime
as food became plentiful here it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture
to something like on average in the high income countries five percent or less of the population in the u s only one percent of the people are actually farmers and it frees us all up
to do other things to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food that is historically a really unique situation
never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people and never before have so
so as food became more plentiful bread became cheaper as it became cheaper bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things we added in more sugar we add in raisins
and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread from a simple food into kind of a support for calories
and today bread now is associated with obesity which is very strange it is the basic most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years wheat is the most important crop the first crop
we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today but this is now this strange concoction of high calories
find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava so bread has become from a main staple
a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity of modern life and the whiter the bread in many countries the better it is
so this is the story of bread as we know it now but of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large scale and large scale has meant
what we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about and this is where i have to query all of you how many of you can actually tell wheat
apart from other cereals how many of you can actually make a bread in this way without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor
can you bake bread do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs we have become very removed from what our bread really is which again evolutionarily speaking is very strange in fact not many of you know that
bread of course was not a european invention it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular the tiny spike on the left to the center
is actually the forefather of wheat this is where it all comes from and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago put us on the road of
now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production there is a counter movement that emerged very much also here in california
don't we all agree i certainly agree i would love to go back to tuscany to this kind of traditional setting gastronomy good food
this is a fallacy and the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about if we do this if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming
we are going actually to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands among whom i have lived for many years working without electricity and water to try to improve their food production we relegate them to poverty
what they want are implements to increase their production something to fertilize the soil something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market
we cannot just think that small scale is the solution to the world food problem it's a luxury solution for us who can afford it if you want to afford it
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this if we say just small scale production as is the tendency here to go back to local food means that a poor man like hans rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in scandinavia we don't have oranges
so local food production is out but also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas and we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation so we must find other solutions
the main driver of that is actually meat and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cereals
that need for animal protein is going to continue we can discuss alternatives in another talk perhaps one day but this is our driving force so what can we do can we find a solution to produce more
yes but we need mechanization and i'm making a real plea here i feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer
to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice one hundred and fifty thousand times just to plant a crop and weed it you cannot ask people to work under these conditions we need
we will not do that through small farmers markets because these people have no small farmers markets at their disposal
they have low incomes and they benefit from cheap affordable safe and diverse food that's what we must aim for in the next twenty to thirty years but yes there are some solutions and let me just do
one simple conceptual thing if i plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale what you see is that we've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture which was
small scale and low control we've moved towards large scale and very high control what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there
go to a kind of regional scale not just in terms of the scale of the fields but in terms of the entire food network
that's where we should move and the ultimate may be but it doesn't apply to cereals that we have entirely closed ecosystems the horticultural systems right at the top left hand corner
so we need to think differently about agriculture science agriculture science for most people and there are not many farmers among you here
has this name of being bad of being about pollution about large scale about the destruction of the environment that is not necessary we need more science and not less and we need good science so what kind of science can we have well first of all
i think we can do much better on the existing technologies use biotechnology where useful particularly in pest and disease resistance
there are also robots for example who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch we have much cleverer
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small scale and large scale
we need to think that land is multi functional it has different functions there are different ways in which we must use it for residential for nature for agriculture purposes
and we also need to re examine livestock go regional and go to urban food systems i want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements i want to have horticulture
and greenhouses on top of residential areas and i want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas
all kinds of ways we can do it we cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture but we can do a lot more
and the main thing that i would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries or as you stay here ask your government for an integrated
food policy food is as important as energy as security as the environment everything is linked together
so we can do that in fact in a densely populated country like the river delta where i live in the netherlands we have combined these functions so this is not science fiction we
but there is something you must do it's not enough for me to say let 's get more bold science into agriculture you must go back and think about your own food chain talk to farmers when was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer
talk to people in restaurants understand where you are in the food chain where your food comes from understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events and that frees you up to do other things
and above all to me food is about respect it's about understanding when you eat that there are also many people who are still in this situation
who are still struggling for their daily food and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution
is really not morally justified we need to help to lift them out of poverty we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive
never before as i said has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap
and i think there is nobody else who has expressed better to me the idea that food in the end in our own tradition
is something holy it's not about nutrients and calories it's about sharing it's about honesty it's about identity who said this so beautifully
was mahatma gandhi seventy five years ago when he spoke about bread he did not speak about rice in india he said
to those who have to go without two meals a day god can only appear as bread and so
finishing my bread here and i've been baking it and i'll try not to burn my hands let me share with those of you here in the first row
share some of the food with you take some of my bread and as you eat it and as you try it please come and stand up
first wheat varieties and to the farmers of today who 've been making this and you don't even know who they are every meal you
contains ingredients from all across the world everything makes us so privileged that we can eat this food that we don't struggle every day and
i think evolutionarily speaking is unique we've never had that before so enjoy your bread eat it and feel privileged thank you very much
