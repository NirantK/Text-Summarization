grow homes because we can right now america is in an unremitting state of trauma and there's a cause for that all right we've got
mchouses as an architect i have to confront something like this so what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses
well it's been around for two thousand five hundred years it's called pleaching or grafting trees together or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous vascular system
and we do something different than what we did in the past we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that we use cnc to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter plants into a specific geometry
that makes a home that we call a fab tree hab it fits into the environment it is the environment it is the landscape right and you can have a hundred million of these homes and it's great
because they suck carbon they're perfect you can have one hundred million families or take things out of the suburbs because these are homes that are a part of the environment imagine pre growing a village
takes about seven to ten years and everything is green so not only do we do the veggie house we also
the in vitro meat habitat or homes that we're doing research on now in brooklyn where as an architecture office for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab
and what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs we use a modified inkjet printer and we print geometry we print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like you know shoes leather belts handbags etc
where no sentient creature is harmed it's victimless it's meat from a test tube so our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes
so here is a typical stud wall an architectural construction and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house where you can see we use
fatty cells as insulation cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat that's why we grow homes thanks very much
