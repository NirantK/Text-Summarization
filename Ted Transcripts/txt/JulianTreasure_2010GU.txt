the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this listen to this this is an uncompressed piece of music
and now the same piece of music with ninety eight percent of the data removed
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two there is a cost of compression it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up
