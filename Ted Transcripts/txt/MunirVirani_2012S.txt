there are ten thousand species of birds
when you see a vulture like this
the first thing that comes to your mind is these are disgusting ugly greedy creatures that are just after your flesh associated with politicians
first of all why do they have such a bad press
when charles darwin went across the atlantic in one thousand eight hundred and thirty two on the beagle he saw the turkey vulture and he said these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads
that are formed to revel in putridity
you could not get a worse insult and that from charles darwin
more recently if you 've been following the kenyan press
but i want to challenge that i want to challenge that do you know why because mps
do not keep the environment clean
and then the old world vultures where we have sixteen species from these sixteen eleven of them are facing a high risk of extinction
so why are vultures important
first of all they provide vital ecological services they clean up they 're our natural garbage collectors they clean up carcasses right to the bone they help to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases
vultures also have tremendous historical significance they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture
nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood and together with the cobra symbolized the unity between upper and lower egypt
in hindu mythology jatayu was the vulture god and he risked his life
in order to save the goddess sita from the ten headed demon ravana
in tibetan culture they are performing very important sky burials in places like tibet there are no places to bury the dead or wood to cremate them so these vultures provide a natural disposal system
so what is the problem with vultures
we have eight species of vultures that occur in kenya of which six are highly threatened with extinction
the reason is that they 're getting poisoned and the reason that they 're getting poisoned is because there 's human wildlife conflicts the pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators and in return the vultures are falling victim to this
in south asia in countries like india and pakistan four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered which means they have less than ten or fifteen years to go extinct and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like diclofenac
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india and they have taken a stand
because there are no vultures there 's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites and when you have feral dogs you have a huge time bomb of rabies the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in india
kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa three hundred and fifty three wind turbines are going to be up at lake turkana i am not against wind energy but we need to work with the governments because wind turbines do this to birds they slice them in half they are bird blending machines
in west africa there 's a horrific trade
of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market
so what 's being done well we 're conducting research on these birds we 're putting transmitters on them we 're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go
we can see that they travel different countries so if you focus on a problem locally it 's not going to help you we need to work with governments in regional levels
we 're working with local communities
we 're talking to them about appreciating vultures about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide
how can you help you can become active make noise
you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures
volunteer your time to spread the word
spread the word when you walk out of this room you will be informed about vultures but speak to your families to your children to your neighbors about vultures
they are very graceful charles darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies
kenya this world will be much poorer without these wonderful species
