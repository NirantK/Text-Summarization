say my name is emmanuel jal and i come from a long way i've been telling a story that has been
so painful for me it's been a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a
book and also telling it like now and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have branded myself as a war child doing this because of
lady in my village now who have lost her children there is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society and i'm doing it for a young man
who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to
also one thing that kept me pushing this story this painful stories out the dreams
is like the voices of the that i have seen
well i was born in the most difficult time when my country was at war
seeing people die every day my mother crying it's like i was raised in a violence
that made me call myself a war child and not only that when i was eight i became a child soldier
i didn't know what was the war for but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head
when i went to the training camp i say i want to kill as many muslims and as many arabs as possible
the training wasn't easy but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my
what was actually killing us wasn't the muslims wasn't the arabs it was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil the diamond the gold and the land
so realizing the truth give me a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go
so i happened to forgive now i sing music with the muslims i dance with them i even had a movie out called war child funded by so
that pain has gone out but my story is huge so i'm just going to go into a different step now which is easier for me i'm going to give you
to sin which is from my album war child i talk about my story one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat
my friend because we had no food and we were like around four hundred and only sixteen people survived that journey so i hope you're going to hear this
my dreams are like torment my every moment voices in my brain of friends that was slain
friends like lual who died by my side of starvation in the burning jungle and the desert plain
next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my
he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and
i knew it was rude but was needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to
to sin to make a living sometimes you gotta lose to win never give up never give
left home at the age of seven one year later live with an ak forty seven by my side slept with one eye open wide run duck play dead and hide
seen my people die like flies but i've never seen a dead body at least one that i've killed but still as i wonder
go under guns barking like lightning and thunder as a child so young and tender words i can't forget i still remember
i saw sergeant command raising his hand no retreat no surrender i carry the banner of the trauma war child child without a
still fighting in the saga yet as i wage this new war i'm not alone in this drama no sit or stop
for the top i'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop i'm on a fight day and night sometime i do wrong in order to make things right
it's like i'm living a dream first time i'm feeling like a human being
the children of darfur your empty bellies on the telly and it's you
don't even know the day i'll ever return my country is war torn music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns so many people die that i don't even cry no more
question what am i here for and why are my people poor and why why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight
what energized me and kept me going is the music i do i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music
been my therapy for me it's been where i actually see heaven where i can be happy where i can be a child again in dances through music
so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system your mind your heart influence your soul and your spirit and can even
the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg
without even wanting to do it and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love
love doesn't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when
i was still a soldier back then i hated the people in the north but i don't know why i don't hate
to come and entertain the soldiers and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music but i had this question so now i'm doing music so i know what the power of music
so what's happening here i've been in a painful journey today is day number two hundred and thirty three in which i only eat dinner i don't eat breakfast no lunch
and i've done a campaign called lose to win where i'm losing so that i could win the battle that i'm fighting now so my breakfast my
i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan and i'm doing this because also
it's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west i choose not to so in my village now kids
they normally listen to bbc or any radio and they are waiting to know the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school
and so i made a commitment i say i 'm gonna not eat my breakfast i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month but i've been humbled so
it's taken me two hundred and thirty two days and i said no stop until we get it and like it's been done on facebook myspace the people are giving three dollars
the lowest amount we ever got was twenty cents somebody donated twenty cents online i don't know how they did it but moved me and so
the importance of education to me is what i'm willing to die for i'm willing to die for this because i know what it can do
to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many chances and you're able to survive
get the food that drops from the sky from the u n so these people you're killing a whole generation if you just give them
if anybody want to help us this is what we need give us tools give the farmers tools it's rain africa is fertile they can grow invest in education
all those old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then we'll be able to change africa that's what i'm asking
in order to do that i founded a charter called gua africa where we put kids in school and
now we have a couple in university we have like forty kids ex child soldiers mixed with anybody we feel like we want to support and i said i 'm going to put it in practice
and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things that's what i want to do to change to make a difference in the world well now my time is going so i want to sing a song
but i'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here
i'm gonna sing this song just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference she came to my country and saw the importance
of education she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women educating them educating the children
so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society so she even ended up marrying a commander from
and she rescued over one hundred and fifty child soldiers one of them happened to be me and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate emma with me are you guys ready to celebrate emma disease
disease and i
and i the
