talk about billions let 's talk about past and future
billions we know that about one hundred and six billion people have ever lived and we know that most of them are dead
and we also know that most of them live or lived in asia and we also know that most of them were or are very poor did not live
for very long let 's talk about billions let 's talk about the one hundred and ninety five thousand billion dollars of wealth
in the world today we know that most of that wealth was
made after the year one thousand eight hundred and we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call westerners europeans north americans
australasians nineteen percent of the world 's population today westerners own two thirds of its wealth
economic historians call this the great divergence and this slide here is the best simplification of the great divergence story i can offer you
it 's basically two ratios of per capita gdp per capita gross domestic product so average income one the red line is the ratio of british to indian
for differences in the cost of living it 's based on purchasing power parity the average american is nearly twenty times richer than the average chinese by
this wasn 't just an economic story if you take the ten countries that went on to become
the western empires in one thousand five hundred they were really quite tiny five percent of the world 's land surface sixteen percent of its population maybe twenty percent of its income
fifty eight percent of the world 's territory about the same percentage of its population and a really huge nearly three quarters share of global economic output and notice most of that went to the motherland to the imperial metropoles not to their colonial possessions
one empire was the least original thing that the west did after one thousand five hundred everybody did empire
samuel johnson the great lexicographer posed it through his character rasselas in his novel rasselas prince of abissinia published in one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine by what means are the europeans thus powerful or why
plant colonies in their ports and give laws to their natural princes
the same wind that carries them back would bring us thither that 's a great question and you know what it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the resterners by the people in the rest of the world like ibrahim muteferrika
the man who introduced printing very belatedly to the ottoman empire who said in a book published in one thousand seven hundred and thirty one why do christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious ottoman armies
unlike rasselas muteferrika had an answer to that question which was correct
he said it was because they have laws and rules invented
it 's not geography you may think we can explain the great divergence in terms of geography we know that 's wrong because we conducted two great natural experiments in the twentieth century to see if geography mattered more than institutions we took all the germans we divided them roughly in two
and we gave the ones in the east communism
and you see the result within an incredibly short period of time people living in the german democratic republic produced trabants the trabbi one of the world 's worst ever cars while people in the west produced the mercedes benz if you still don 't believe me
we conducted the experiment also in the korean peninsula and we decided we 'd take koreans in roughly the same geographical place with notice the same basic traditional culture and we divided them in two and we gave the northerners communism and the result
is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in germany not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly but in almost every other respect it 's a huge divergence
which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character popular explanations for this kind of thing are really significant
it 's the ideas it 's the institutions this must be true because a scotsman said it and i think i 'm the only scotsman here at the edinburgh ted so let me just
there was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies but
but this complement may be much inferior to what with other laws and institutions the nature of its soil climate and situation might admit of that is so right and so cool and he said it such a long time ago but you know
this is a ted audience and if i keep talking about institutions you 're going to turn off so i 'm going to translate this into language that you can understand
let 's call them the killer apps i want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the west apart from the rest and they 're kind of like the apps on your phone in the sense that they look quite simple
they 're just icons you click on them but behind the icon there 's complex code it 's the same with institutions there are six which i think explain the great divergence one competition two the scientific revolution three property rights
four modern medicine five the consumer society and six the work ethic you can play a game and try and think of one i 've missed at or try and boil it down to just four but you 'll lose
competition means not only were there a hundred different political units in europe in one thousand five hundred but within each of these units there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns the ancestor of the modern corporation the city of london corporation existed in the twelfth century nothing like this existed in china where there was one
monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters
and very complex confucian essay writing
the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways the most important being that through the experimental method it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before
example benjamin robins 's extraordinary application of newtonian physics to ballistics
once you do that your artillery becomes accurate
think of what that means that really was a killer application
property rights it 's not the democracy folks it 's having the rule of law based on private property rights that 's what makes the difference between north america and south america you could turn up in north america having signed a deed of indenture saying i 'll work for nothing for five years you just have to feed me
but at the end of it you 've got a hundred acres of land
that 's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide
that 's not possible in latin america where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors and you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between north and south most people in rural north america owned some land
by one thousand nine hundred hardly anyone in south america did that 's another killer app modern medicine in the late nineteenth century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people and this was another killer app the very opposite
of a killer because it doubled and then more than doubled human life expectancy it even did that in the european empires
even in places like senegal beginning in the early twentieth century there were major breakthroughs in public health and life expectancy began to rise it doesn 't rise any faster after these countries become independent the empires weren 't all bad the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point
you need people to want to wear tons of clothes you 've all bought an article of clothing in the last month i guarantee it that 's the consumer society and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself japan was the first non western society to embrace it the alternative
which was proposed by mahatma gandhi was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi 's road finally the work ethic
max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant he was wrong any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work we know this
because today the work ethic is no longer a protestant western phenomenon in fact the west has lost its work ethic
today the average korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average german a thousand
and this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon and that is the end of the great divergence who 's got the work ethic now take a look at mathematical attainment by fifteen year olds at the top of the international league table according to the latest pisa study
is the shanghai district of china the gap between shanghai and the united kingdom and the united states is as big as the gap between the u k and the u s and albania and tunisia
you probably assume that because the iphone was designed in california but assembled in china that the west still leads in terms of technological innovation you 're wrong in terms of patents there 's no question that the east is ahead not only has japan been ahead for some time
south korea has gone into third place and china is just about to overtake germany why
because the killer apps can be downloaded it 's open source
any society can adopt these institutions and when they do they achieve what the west achieved after one thousand five hundred only faster this is the great reconvergence and it 's the biggest story of your lifetime because it 's on your watch that this is happening
it 's our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance the average american used to be more than twenty times richer than the average chinese now it 's just five times and soon it will be two point five times
so i want to end with three questions for the future billions just ahead of two thousand and sixteen when the united states will lose its place as number one economy to china
the first is can you delete these apps and are we in the process of doing so in the western world
the second question is does the sequencing of the download matter and could africa get that sequencing wrong
one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it 's quite hard to transition to democracy before you 've established secure private property rights warning that may not work and third can china do without killer app number three
that 's the one that john locke systematized when he said that freedom
was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law
that 's the basis for the western model of representative government now this picture shows the demolition of the chinese artist ai weiwei 's studio in shanghai earlier this year he 's now free again having been detained as you know for some time but i don 't think his studio has been rebuilt
winston churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight and i think these words really nail it
it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians it means that violence the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs the conditions of camps and warfare of riot and tyranny
give place to parliaments where laws are made and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained that is civilization and in its soil grow continually freedom
comfort and culture what all tedsters care about most when civilization reigns in any country a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people that 's so true
i don 't think the decline of western civilization is inevitable because i don 't think history operates in this kind of life cycle model
beautifully illustrated by thomas cole 's course of empire paintings that 's not the way history works that 's not the way the west rose and i don 't think it 's the way the west will fall
complex civilizations do that because they operate most of the time
on the edge of chaos that 's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations
no we may hang on despite the huge burdens of debt that we 've accumulated despite the evidence that we 've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo
but one thing is for sure the great divergence is over folks thanks very much
just curious about your take on the other region of the world that 's booming which is latin america what 's your view on that
he was an expert in latin american history he said i don 't know i 'll have to think about that that tells you something really important i think if you look at what is happening in brazil in particular but also chile which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life there 's a very bright future indeed
so my story really is as much about that convergence in the americas as it 's a convergence story in eurasia
