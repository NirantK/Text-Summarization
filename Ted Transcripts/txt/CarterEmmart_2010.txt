the flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste
it wasn't until we really left earth got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself
the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history
over the past twelve years we maintain that
put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales
what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe as we see
nasa supported this work twelve years ago
as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do
our main space shows in the dome but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with linkoping university in sweden
i've had twelve students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uniview and a company called sciss in sweden
this software allows interactive use so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live
captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live
and it was done as a collaborative project
with the rubin museum of
for an exhibit on comparative cosmology
and so as we move out
we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies as we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are
the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long we're
backing up into the past we
so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang this is the
see we'll fly outside it here just to see this sort of containment if we were outside this it would almost be meaningless in the sense as before time
but this our containment of the visible universe we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see coming back quickly
we see here the radiosphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped
and our sun here obviously with our own solar system what you're going to see you're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down
orbit of the moon and we see the
can be updated and we can add in new data
i know doctor carolyn porco is the camera p i for the cassini mission but here we see the complex trajectory of the cassini mission color coded for different mission phases
this software allows us to come close and look at parts of this this software can also be networked between domes we have a growing
user base of this and we network domes and we can network between domes and classrooms we're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub saharan planetarium in
as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia
and the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school
this is an image from saturday photographed by the aqua satellite but through the uniview software and so you're seeing the edge of the earth this is nepal this is in fact right here is the valley of lhasa here in tibet
we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india this is nepal and tibet
to say this beautiful world that we live on
bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out
so i'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is
because our home is the universe and we are the universe essentially we carry that in us and to be able to see our
