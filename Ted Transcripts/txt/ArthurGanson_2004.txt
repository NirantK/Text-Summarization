kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal space and i would make things
make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my love i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas
and my passions into objects and sort of learning how to speak with my hands so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected
with not only the idea realm but also with very much the feeling realm and
the ideas are very disparate i'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain
and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life and seeing nature and seeing objects and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things
when i was a child i started to explore
i fell in love with the way things moved
so i started to explore motion by making little
and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade
and i remember when i was doing this i was thinking about that little rock there and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air and how
the characters would come shooting out of the car so on my mind i was
thinking about the trajectory of
the vehicles and of course when you're a little kid there's always destruction
so it has to end with this gratuitous violence
so that was how i first started to explore
the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to college i found myself
making fairly complicated fragile machines
and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests when i was in high school i loved to program computers so i sort of liked the logical flow of events
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon
it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way
so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands
with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of
flows of energy through a
also working with wire everything that i did was both
visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time so i was able to sort of exercise all of that now this
kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting and it's full of
many little trivial end points like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything it's really just
for the sort of joy of its own
connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i'm doing is really completely ambiguous
really completely ambiguous that's pretty ambiguous
that's pretty ambiguous the next piece that
is going to come up is
an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex
i gave myself the problem since i'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth
so when i started this i didn't have an overall plan for the machine
but i did have a sense of the gesture and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point
it really it's almost like doing it came about from
playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things so i had this wishbone and i thought
it's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that
so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone is bone it's animal it's sort of a point where i
think we can enter into it
this kind of work is also very much like puppetry
where the found object is in a sense the puppet and i'm the puppeteer at first because i'm playing with an object but then i make the machine which is sort of the stand in for me and it is able to achieve the action that i want
the next piece i'll show you is a much more conceptual thought and it's a little piece called cory 's yellow chair
i had this image in my mind
when i saw my son 's little chair and i saw it explode
so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move far out
then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center and they would coalesce for just a moment
so you could perceive that there was a chair there
for me it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment and i wanted to express that now
the machine is in this case it's a real approximation of that because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously
this whole thing is about four feet wide and the chair itself
is only about a few inches
on the left and it goes through a gear train there are twelve pairs of fifty to one reductions
so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once so i've invented it in concrete because it doesn't really matter all the
now a completely different thought i'm always imagining myself
in different situations i'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil
so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself
and it's really just sort of for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil
i got a call from a friend
who wanted to have a show of erotic art and i didn't have any pieces but when she suggested
to be in the show this piece came to mind so it's sort of related but you can see it's much more overtly erotic
this is a happy machine i'll tell you it's definitely happy
from an engineering point of view this is just a little four bar linkage and then again this is a found object a little fan that i found and i thought
what about the gesture of opening the fan and how simply could i state something and in a case like this i'm trying to make something which
is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant for me the process
is very important because i'm inventing machines but i'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning
so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly
my life completely changed when i found a spot welder
and that was that tool it completely changed what i could do now here i'm going to do a very
poor job of silver soldering
this is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school i just like throw it in i mean real jewelers put little bits of solder so that's a finished
when i moved to boston i joined a group
called the world sculpture racing society and the idea
their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line
so i made this is my first racing sculpture and i thought
oh i'm going to make a cart and i'm going to have it i'm going to have my hand writing faster so as i run down the street the cart 's going to talk to me and it's going to go faster faster
so that's what it does
then in the end what i decided was
every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i'm always stopping
now i only have two and a half minutes i'm going to play
this is a piece that for me is in some ways the most complete kind of piece because when i was a kid i also played a lot of guitar
and when i had this thought i was imagining that i would make
i would have a whole machine theater evening where i would you would have an audience the curtain would open and you'd be entertained by machines on stage so i
a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair and
i'm making these pieces i'm always trying to find a point where
saying something very clearly and it's very simple but also at the same time it's very ambiguous
and i think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it
and that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart
and i do my best at finding ways to express them with materials and it always feels really crude it's always a struggle
but somehow i manage to sort of get this thought out into an object
and then it's there ok it means nothing at all the object itself just means nothing once it's perceived and
someone brings it into their own mind then there's a cycle that has been completed and to me that's the most important thing because
ever since being a kid i've wanted to communicate my passion and love and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical to someone perceiving
so i'll just let this chair
