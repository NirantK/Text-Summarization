changing with really remarkable speed if you look at the chart at the top here
and if you look at the chart for two thousand and fifty it's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size
of the american economy and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy
should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis a couple of weeks ago i was looking at the latest projection by bnp paribas for when china will
twenty that's just a decade away china is going to change the world in two fundamental respects
first of all it's a huge developing country with a population of one point three billion people which has been growing for over thirty years at around ten percent a year
and within a decade it will have the largest economy in the world never before in the modern era
has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country rather than a developed country secondly for the first time in the modern era
the dominant country in the world which i think is what china will become will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots
now i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize they also westernize this is an illusion
it's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition markets and technology it is not it is also shaped equally by history and culture china is not like the west
and it will not become like the west it will remain in very fundamental respects very different
now the big question here is obviously how do we make sense of china how do we try to understand what china is and the problem we have
west at the moment by and large is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms using western ideas
we can 't now i want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what china is like just as a beginning the first is this that china
not really a nation state okay it's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years but everyone who knows anything about china knows it's a lot older than this
this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in two hundred and twenty one b c at the end of the warring state period the birth of modern china and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china
or immediately afterward the han dynasty still two thousand years ago and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and
live now now what is extraordinary about this is what gives china it's sense of being china what gives
the chinese the sense of what it is to be chinese comes not from the last hundred years not from the nation state period which is what happened in the west
from the period if you like of the civilization state i'm thinking here for example of
customs like ancestral worship of a very distinctive notion of the state likewise a very distinctive notion of the family social relationships like
unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as a civilization state rather than as a nation state and there's one
and that is this of course we know china 's big huge demographically and geographically with a population of one point three billion people what we often
really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pluralistic
and in many ways very decentralized you can't run a place on this scale simply from beijing even though we think this to be the case it's never been the case
so this is china a civilization state rather than a nation state and what does it mean well i think it has all sorts of profound implications i'll give you two quick ones
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity is the maintenance of
chinese civilization you know two thousand years ago europe breakdown the fragmentation of the holy roman empire it divided and it's remained divided ever since china
the same time period went in exactly the opposite direction very painfully holding this huge civilization civilization state together the second is
one country two systems and i'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the west believed them window dressing when china gets it's hands on hong kong that won 't be the case thirteen years on
one nation one system that is the nation state mentality but you can't run a country like china a civilization state on the basis of one civilization one system it
so actually the response of china to the question of hong kong as it will be to the question of taiwan was a natural response one civilization
many systems let me offer you another building block to try and understand china maybe not such a comfortable one
the chinese have a very very different conception of race to most other countries do you know of the
one point three billion chinese over ninety percent of them think they belong to the same race the
now this is completely different from the other world 's most populous countries india the united states indonesia brazil all of them
the chinese don't feel like that china is only multiracial really
the margins so the question is why well the reason i think essentially is again back to the civilization state
nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that
china could never have held together the han identity has been the cement which has held this country together
the great disadvantage of it is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference they really believe in
their own superiority and they are disrespectful of those who are not hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to
or let me give you my third building block the chinese state now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west
now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think in these days at least that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy the problem with this proposition is that
the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority
amongst the chinese than is true with any western state
and the reason for this is because well there are two reasons i think and it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy because in our terms the chinese certainly don't have a democracy and the reason for this is
because the state in china is given a very special it enjoys a very special significance as the representative the embodiment and the guardian
of chinese civilization of the civilization state this is as close as china gets to a kind of spiritual role
and the second reason is because whereas in europe and north america the state
power is continuously challenged i mean in the european tradition historically against the church against other sectors of the aristocracy against merchants and so on
for one thousand years the power of the chinese state
has not been challenged it's had no serious rivals so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western
history the result by the way is that the chinese have a very different view of the state
whereas we tend to view it as an intruder a stranger certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained the chinese don't see the
the chinese view the state as an intimate not just as an intimate actually as a member of the family not just in fact as a member of the family but as the head of the family the patriarch of the family
this is the chinese view of the state very very different to ours it's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is
the case in the west and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here in the chinese context
a new kind of paradigm which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past
that china believes in the market and the state i mean adam smith already writing in the late eighteenth century said the chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything
in europe and apart from the mao period that has remained more or less the case ever since but this is combined with an extremely strong
and ubiquitous state the state is everywhere in china i mean it's leading firms many of them are still publicly owned private firms however large they are like lenovo depend in many ways on state patronage
this is a very old state tradition a very old tradition of statecraft i mean if you want an illustration of this the great wall is one
this is another this is the grand canal which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b c and was finally completed in the seventh century a d
it went for one thousand one hundred and fourteen miles linking beijing with hangzhou and shanghai
so there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today which is something like the three gorges dam and many other expressions of state
competence within china so there we have three building blocks for trying to to understand the difference that is china the civilization state
the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society
and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china
by simply drawing on western experience looking at it through western eyes using western concepts if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong our predictions about what's going to happen to china
are incorrect this is the reason unfortunately i think i have to say that i think
attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality it's kind of arrogant it's arrogant in the sense that we think that we
best and therefore we have the universal measure and secondly it's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue
of difference you know there's a very interesting passage in a book by paul cohen the american historian and paul cohen argues that the west
thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures but it's not
in many ways it's the most parochial because for two hundred years the west
has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures
other civilizations because at the end of the day it could if necessary by force get its own way
whereas those cultures virtually the rest of the world in fact which have been in a far weaker position vis a vis the west have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west 's presence in those societies and
they are as a result more cosmopolitan in many ways than the west i mean take the question of east asia east asia japan korea china etc
the world 's population lives there now the largest economic region in the world and i'll tell you now that east asianers people from east asia are far more
about the west than the west is about east asia now this point is very germane i'm afraid
to the present because what's happening back to that chart at the beginning the goldman sachs chart what is happening is that
very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven and shaped not by the old developed countries
but by the developing world we've seen this in terms of the g twenty usurping very rapidly the position of the g seven
the g eight and there are two consequences of this first
the west is rapidly losing its
and that is what is going to happen in the future and the second implication is that the world will inevitably as a consequence become increasingly
to us because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with
are unaware about the way the world is changing
some people i've got an english friend in china and he said the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion well maybe that's true maybe that's an exaggeration
but there's another problem which goes along with this that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world and that is a sort of
is no longer true if you want to feel the future if you want to taste the future try china there's old confucius
this is a railway station the like of which you've never seen before it doesn't even look like a railway station this is the new guangzhou railway station for
the high speed trains china already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together
or take this now this is an idea but it's an idea to by tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a
on the upper deck carries about two thousand people it travels on rails down a suburban road and the cars travel underneath it
so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have many many many cities over twenty million people okay so how would i like to finish
what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing
i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it but i want to argue above all
picture positive for this world for two hundred years the world was essentially
the arrival of countries like china and india between them thirty eight percent of the world 's population and others like indonesia and brazil and
the most important single act of democratization in the last two hundred years
as humanists we must welcome surely this transformation and we will have to learn about these civilizations
this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he in the early fifteenth century on his great voyages around the south china sea the east china sea and across the indian ocean to east africa
the little boat in front of it was the one in which eighty years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic
i think they're playing golf christ the chinese even invented golf welcome to the future thank you
