shape","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":404000}},"167":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":406000}},"168":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"It's really a sort of magical moment.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":409000}},"169":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"So this is actually a Dutch company,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":412000}},"170":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"so I called them up, and I
