dollars.","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":77000}},"33":{"caption":{"content":"So what I'm going to show you how to do","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":80000}},"34":{"caption":{"content":"is how to create one with a Wii

hardware,","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":84000}},"36":{"caption":{"content":"which is this infrared pen.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":87000}},"37":{"caption":{"content":"You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":89000}},"38":{"caption":{"content":"with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.","duration":1000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":92000}},"39":{"caption":{"content":"It's essentially got a battery, a button and an infrared LED,","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":93000}},"40":{"caption":{"content":"and it turns on -- you guys can't see it --","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":96000}},"41":{"caption":{"content":"but it turns on whenever I push the button.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":98000}},"42":{"caption":{"content":"Now, what this means is that if I run this piece of software,","duration":4000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":100000}},"43":{"caption":{"content":"the camera sees the infrared dot,","duration":4000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":104000}},"44":{"caption":{"content":"and I can register the location of the camera pixels","duration":5000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":108000}},"45":{"caption":{"content":"to the projector pixels.

the software for this I've actually put on my website","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":133000}},"53":{"caption":{"content":"and have let people download it for free.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":136000}},"54":{"caption":{"content":"And in the three months that this project has been public,","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":138000}},"55":{"caption":{"content":"it's been downloaded over half a million times.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":140000}},"56":{"caption":{"content":"So teachers and students all around the

want to quickly say that although it does do it for 50 dollars,","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":152000}},"60":{"caption":{"content":"there are some limitations of this approach.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":154000}},"61":{"caption":{"content":"But you get about 80 percent of the way there,","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":156000}},"62":{"caption":{"content":"for about one percent of the cost.","duration":1000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":158000}},"63":{"caption":{"content":"Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots,","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":159000}},"64":{"caption":{"content":"so this is actually","duration":1000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":162000}},"65":{"caption":{"content":"a multi-touch, interactive whiteboard system as well.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":163000}},"66":{"caption":{"content":"(Applause)","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":165000}},"67":{"caption":{"content":"For the second demo, I have this Wii remote","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":168000}},"68":{"caption":{"content":"that's actually next to the TV.","duration":1000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":170000}},"69":{"caption":{"content":"So it's pointing away from the display,","duration":1000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":172000}},"70":{"caption":{"content":"rather than pointing at the display.","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":173000}},"71":{"caption":{"content":"And why this is interesting","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":176000}},"72":{"caption":{"content":"is that if you put on, say, a pair of safety glasses,","duration":4000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":178000}},"73":{"caption":{"content":"that have two infrared dots in them,","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":182000}},"74":{"caption":{"content":"what these two dots are essentially going to give you","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":184000}},"75":{"caption":{"content":"is, give the computer an approximation of your head location.","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":186000}},"76":{"caption":{"content":"And why this is interesting","duration":1000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":189000}},"77":{"caption":{"content":"is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor,","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":190000}},"78":{"caption":{"content":"which has a 3D room, with some targets floating in it.","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":193000}},"79":{"caption":{"content":"And you can see that it looks like a 3D room -- if","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":196000}},"80":{"caption":{"content":"you can see -- kind of like a video game, it sort of looks 3D,","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":199000}},"81":{"caption":{"content":"but for the most part, the image looks pretty flat,","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":202000}},"82":{"caption":{"content":"and bound to the surface of the screen.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":204000}},"83":{"caption":{"content":"But if we turn on head tracking,","duration":5000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":206000}},"84":{"caption":{"content":"the computer can change the image that's on the screen","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":211000}},"85":{"caption":{"content":"and make it respond to the head movements.","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":213000}},"86":{"caption":{"content":"So let's switch back to that.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":216000}},"87":{"caption":{"content":"(Laughter)","duration":4000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":218000}},"88":{"caption":{"content":"(Applause)","duration":10000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":222000}},"89":{"caption":{"content":"So

games,","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":243000}},"95":{"caption":{"content":"and actually Louis Castle, that's him down there,","duration":3000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":245000}},"96":{"caption":{"content":"last week announced that Electronic

interesting","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":271000}},"105":{"caption":{"content":"than either of these two products","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":273000}},"106":{"caption":{"content":"is how people actually found out about them.","duration":2000,"startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":275000}},"107":{"caption":{"content":"YouTube has really changed the way, or changed the
