that.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":943000}},"363":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"This is how we envision it would be in a residential

that.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":1049000}},"405":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"So, in conclusion, I would say","startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":1052000}},"406":{"caption":{"duration":6000,"content":"my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new

these.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":1083000}},"415":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"It just makes economic

one.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":1094000}},"420":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"So that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the

mistake.","startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":1135000}},"433":{"caption":{"duration":4000,"content":"But, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for
