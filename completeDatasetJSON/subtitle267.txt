the way I saw this in my mind at first,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":430000}},"116":{"caption":{"duration":4000,"content":"was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":433000}},"117":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"and the pieces would move far out,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":437000}},"118":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"and then they would begin to be pulled
