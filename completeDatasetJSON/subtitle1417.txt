it,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":334000}},"126":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"but it's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":336000}},"127":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And so what we did in that case

disappears.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":355000}},"135":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And the first tape you're going to

are.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":375000}},"143":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And so that's how they bring it

difficult.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":386000}},"145":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"Because the whole purpose of this

example?","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":392000}},"148":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And so what we do in the next step","startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":395000}},"149":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"is we release one elephant before the

enough","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":399000}},"151":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope

has,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":410000}},"156":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"because he puts his big foot on the rope,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":412000}},"157":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"stands on the rope and waits there for the
