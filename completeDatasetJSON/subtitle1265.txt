later.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":222000}},"88":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the

plant.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":277000}},"111":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"Well what he does is he moves around","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":279000}},"112":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"in a very drunken fashion on his

circle.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":286000}},"115":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":289000}},"116":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"it would start to wander about in the space.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":292000}},"117":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And there's no wires.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":294000}},"118":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"So I'll just show you an instance

object.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":298000}},"120":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And it very slowly, over a few minutes,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":300000}},"121":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"sort of painfully goes up,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":302000}},"122":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"and then it gains momentum","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":304000}},"123":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"and it looks like it's almost about to fall.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":306000}},"124":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And this is an important moment,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":308000}},"125":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"because we wanted to instill in the viewer","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":310000}},"126":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":312000}},"127":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"But it doesn't really need it,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":314000}},"128":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":316000}},"129":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"So this work was a real technical challenge for us,","startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":319000}},"130":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":322000}},"131":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":325000}},"132":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"And it was very important for us","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":328000}},"133":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"to establish the exact moment that it would fall,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":330000}},"134":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":333000}},"135":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"then it would damage itself,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":336000}},"136":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":338000}},"137":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"or that sense of wanting to go and help it.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":341000}},"138":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"So I'm going to show you a very quick video","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":343000}},"139":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":345000}},"140":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"That's my colleague. He's let it go.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":347000}},"141":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":349000}},"142":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"But he doesn't need to,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":351000}},"143":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"because it manages to lift itself up on its own.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":353000}},"144":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,","startOfParagraph":true,"startTime":355000}},"145":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"working with the aesthetic of fur","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":358000}},"146":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"embedded with thousands of tiny different

sky.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":366000}},"149":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":368000}},"150":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"which is in the shape of a teddy

point","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":383000}},"157":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"you would stop looking at the form of a teddy
