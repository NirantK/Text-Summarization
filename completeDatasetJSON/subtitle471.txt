around.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":367000}},"148":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"So there's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth,","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":370000}},"149":{"caption":{"duration":2000,"content":"and there's also a

loop.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":387000}},"156":{"caption":{"duration":3000,"content":"And, the other component on a breathing
