together","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":625756}},"262":{"caption":{"duration":2411,"content":"and we think really hard about \ndesigning the

out","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":776822}},"324":{"caption":{"duration":2999,"content":"is that actually, very often, those cells will die","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":779174}},"325":{"caption":{"duration":1795,"content":"once you've implanted them.","startOfParagraph":false,"startTime":782173}},"326":{"caption":{"duration":1875,"content":"And you can either put them into the
